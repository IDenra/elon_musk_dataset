Welcome back.,Here we go again.
Great to see you and congratulations.,Thank you.
"You will never forget what is going on in the world when you think about when your child is born. You will know for the rest of this child’s life, you were born during a weird time.",That’s for sure.
That is for sure. Probably the weirdest that I can remember.,"Yeah. Yeah, and he was born on May the fourth."
"That’s hilarious, too.",Yeah.
May the fourth be with him.,"Yes, exactly."
It has to be.,Hopefully. I sure hope so.
Perfect.,Yes.
"I agree with you. I don’t know, I’m not familiar with it. I know what the SR71 is.","Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Oh wow, what a dope looking plane.",Yeah.
"Oh, okay. I got it.",Yeah.
"Well, as a person who’s a very much into aerial travel as you are, that’s perfect.",It’s pretty great.
They are pretty awesome.,They’re awesome. Yeah.
"When I didn’t have any of my own, I would see other people’s kids and I didn’t not like them, but I wasn’t drawn to them. But now when I see little people’s kids, I’m like, Oh, I think of them as like these little love packages.","Yeah, little love bugs."
"Yeah. It’s just you think of them differently when you see them come out and then grow and then eventually start talking to you, like your whole idea what a baby is, is very different.",Yeah.
"You’re talking about the neural net, you’re not talking about an actual baby.",I’m talking about an actual baby.
That’s a great way to put it.,Yeah.
Now you’re in the middle of this strange time where you’re selling your houses. You say you don’t want any material possessions and I’ve been seeing all that and I’ve been really excited to talk to you about this. Because it’s an interesting thing to come from a guy like yourself. Like why are you doing that?,"I’m slightly sad about it, actually."
Attack vector meaning like people targeted.,Yeah.
"Interesting, yeah. But you’re obviously going to, so you’re going to rent a place?",Yeah.
"Okay, and get rid of everything except clothes?","No, I said like almost everything, so it’s like …"
"Yeah, you can always buy more stuff if you don’t like it.",I suppose so.
Yeah.,Yeah.
"Yeah. Well, I think that people are kind of learning that particularly because of this whole pandemic and this relationship that we have with China, that there’s a lot of value in making things and to making things here.",Yes. Somebody’s got to do the real work.
Don’t you have Gene Wilder’s house?,I do.
That’s amazing.,It’s awesome.
Wow.,Yes. It’s exactly what you’d expect.
Did you request that the buyer not fuck it up?,"Yeah, that’s a requirement."
"Oh, a requirement? That’s a good requirement.",Yeah.
"Oh, he’s a legend. He’d want his soul, he’d want his essence in the building.",And it’s there.
Is it?,"It’s a real quirky house, yeah."
Did you ever live in it?,"It’s very quirky. I did live in it briefly, yeah."
Yeah.,For sure.
5%? That’s a good chunk.,"It’s a good chunk. Yeah, yeah."
It does sometimes.,"Yeah, yeah."
The old TVs.,It did.
My grandpa used to slap the top.,For sure. Yeah.
"Well, let’s talk about what you can talk about to what Neuralink is cause the last time you were here you really couldn’t discuss it. Then there was, I guess a press release or something that sort of outlined … [crosstalk 00:18:04]","Oh yeah, sure, sure."
Whoa.,"Yeah, maybe slightly better."
Slightly better?,"Over time, yes."
"Right, that’s pretty cheap.",Yeah. Yeah.
$6 billion man.,Yeah.
"Oh yeah, I believe you.","Yeah, you basically implant the device."
"Oh, okay.",Yeah.
"Okay, so you take this one diameter like ice fishing, right? You ever go ice fishing?","No, but I’d like to."
"Through this one inch diameter device, electrodes would be inserted and they will find their way …","Like tiny wires, basically."
Tiny wires.,Tiny wires.
"Oh, okay.","Yeah, you insert …"
They just find the spots?,Yeah.
Would this be replaceable or reversible?,Yeah.
"Like if someone can’t take it anymore? I’m too smart, I can’t take it.","Yeah, you can totally take it out."
"Restoring memory and what is happening that’s allowing it to do that? Like the wires, these small wires are stimulating these areas of the brain. Is it that the areas of the brain are losing some sort of electrical force? What is happening?",Yeah.
A specific frequency will go through this?,Yeah.
Symbiosis is a scary word when it comes to AI.,It’s optional.
I would hope so.,Yeah.
"It’s just, I mean, once you enjoy the Doctor Manhattan lifestyle, once you become a god seems very unlikely you’re going to want to go back to being stupid again. I mean, you literally could fundamentally change the way human beings interface with each other.",Yes.
Yes.,You wouldn’t need to talk.
Glasses.,"Yeah, yeah. Your electronic devices."
Yes. Great movie.,"Yeah, great on."
"There’s an interpretation factor, too. Like you can choose to interpret certain series of words in different ways and they’re dependent upon tone, dependent upon social cues, even facial expressions, sarcasm. There’s a lot of variables.",Sarcasm is difficult.
Yes.,Yeah.
"…from first grade on, how to use some new universal language. I mean essentially like a Rosetta Stone and something that’s done, that interprets your thoughts and you can convey your thoughts with no room for interpretation. With clear, very clear, where you know what a person’s saying and you could tell them what you’re saying. There’s no need for noises, no need for mouth noises.",Yes.
"No need for these accepted ways that we’ve evolved to make sounds that we all agree, through our cultural dictionary, and we agree. We could bypass all that.",You can still do it for sentimental reasons.
Right.,Just download the program.
"Right. So at least for the first iterations, first few iterations. I know that Google has some of their pixel buds have the ability to interpret languages in real time.",Sure.
Yeah. You can hear it and it’ll play things back to you in whatever language you choose. So it’d be something along those lines.,Yeah.
That’s quick. That’s really quick.,That’s the best case scenario.
No talking anymore in five years.,"Best case scenario, but 10 years is more like it."
"They’re like if you went from australopithecus or ancient hominid to us, what’s the difference? Less hair, less muscle, bigger head and then just keep going. A thousand, a million, whatever year or five years, whatever. Whatever happens when Neuralink goes on online and then we slowly start to adapt to this new way of being where we don’t use our muscles anymore. We have this gigantic head, we can talk without words.",You could also save state.
"But the idea of saving yourself and then transforming that into some sort of a biological state, you can hang out with 30 year old you?",I mean the possibilities are endless.
Crystal clear.,Including all the entire sensory experience.
"Emotions, everything.",Everything.
Edit it?,Yeah.
It could be.,Yeah.
"The idea that we’re experiencing some sort of a preserved memory is, even though it’s still the same, it’s not comforting. Right? For some reason when people talk about simulation theory, they talk about the potential for this currently being a simulation. Even though your life might be wonderful, you might be in love, you might love your career, you might have great friends, but it’s not comforting to know that this experience somehow or another doesn’t exist in a material form that you can knock on.",It feels real doesn’t it?
"All your hormones, all your neuro-transmitters, all these things are drugs. Adrenaline’s a drug. Dopamine is a drug. You’re a drug factory. You’re constantly changing your state with love and oxytocin and beauty.",Sure.
"When do we call it, when do we call it consciousness? I was watching a video today that we played on a podcast earlier of a monkey riding a motorcycle down the street, jumps off the motorcycle and tries to steal a baby.",Yeah. I saw that one. It went viral.
"That’s a great way of putting it. Aspire to be less wrong. But then when people look back in nostalgia about simpler times, there’s that too. It’s very romantic and exciting to look back on campfires.",You can still have a campfire.
Yes. But will you appreciate it when you’re a super nerd? When you connect it to the grid and you have some skull cap in place of the top of your head and it’s interfacing with the international language that the rest of the universe now enjoys communication with people?,Yeah. Sure. I think so. Yeah. I like campfires.
"I’m just worried. I mean, everyone’s always scared of change, but I’m scared of this monumental change where we won’t talk anymore. I mean that thing that you [crosstalk 00:42:53].",We’ll communicate.
But the fact that a human did it too.,"Yeah, absolutely."
Do you think that it will be like electronic music? Like people won’t appreciate it like they appreciate a slide guitar?,I like electronic music.
I do too. Well you make it. I know you like it.,Sure.
I hope it’s more fun and interesting too.,Yeah.
"Well that is a problem too, right? If someone can manipulate that technology to make something appear logical or rational.",Yeah. Yeah.
"Would that be an issue too, this is a very have versus have not issue. If this really does, I mean initially it’s going to help people with injuries, but you said ultimately it could lead to this spectacular cognitive change.",Yes.
"Decoupled from human. So this is the, if you can’t beat them, join them?",Yeah.
When do you think you’re going to do it? How long will you wait? Once it starts becoming available?,"Yeah, if it works I’ll do it. Sure."
Right away.,I mean let’s make sure it works.
"You see it coming, but when do you think it’s going to be? When you’re alone, if you have free time, I don’t know if you have free time, but if you just sit down and think about this iteration, the next onward, keep going and you drag it out with improvements along the way and leaps and bounds and technological innovations. Where do you see it? What are we going to be?",Like when?
A whole brain interface?,Something pretty close to that. Yeah.
AI extension of yourself.,Yeah.
That’s a good way to put it. It is weird when you read someone’s tweets after they’re dead.,Yeah.
"Whoa. Now, when you say civilization’s fragile, do you mean because of this COVID-19 shit that’s going on right now?",What’s that? I never heard of it.
"It’s this thing, it’s like some people just get a cough.",I have no idea what you’re talking about.
It seems.,So I think it’s a problem that’s not good.
It seems like the state of public perception is shifting.,It is.
Well there’s a speculation why men get it more than women because men are disgusting. We don’t wash our hands as much.,Men are disgusting it’s true. It’s bad.
"Yeah. When you made a series of tweets recently, I don’t remember the exact wording, but essentially you were saying, “Free America now.” Like, let’s open it back-",That is the exact wording.
"That is it? Thank you. How much do you pay attention to the response to that stuff and what was the response like? Did anybody go, “Hey man, what the fuck you doing?” Did anybody pull you aside?","Yeah, of course."
"Oh yeah. Twitter. Yeah, but I don’t read that. Do you read it.",It’s a war zone.
Yeah.,"I mean, people knife you good and thorough."
Twitter war zone.,And it takes a lot to phase me at this point.
Right.,Yeah.
"Right, right.",Or a “just kidding” or-
"It seems like it would take away some of the fun from people that know it’s sarcasm. Like if everybody knew that The Onion wasn’t, if you sent people articles. It was something about someone getting angry and an Onion article.","Wow, that’s amazing."
"Do you know who Titania McGrath is? It’s Andrew Boyle. He’s a British fellow. Brilliant guy who’s been on the podcast before and he has this a fictional character, this a pseudonym Titania McGrath who’s like the ultimate social justice warrior.","Is this, like, a female avatar."
Yes.,"Oh, okay."
"A female avatar that’s actually a computer conglomeration of a bunch of faces. It’s not really one person. So, one person can’t be a victim and be angry, but he’s sort of combined these faces to make this one perfect social justice warrior. But I recognized it early on before I met him. That this was parody. This was just fun. And then I love reading the people that don’t recognize that. They get angry. And there’s a lot of people that just get really furious. There’s some fun to that. There’s some fun to the not picking up on the true nature of the signal.",I find Twitter quite engaging.
Did you feel the same way when CNN had that stupid shit about ventilators with you? I found that both confusing and-,Yeah. That was annoying.
It was annoying.,It was wrong.
What is also annoying as a person who reads CNN and wants to think of them as a responsible conveyor of the facts. I would like to think that-,"Well, yeah. I don’t think CNN is that."
I go with whatever Matt Taibbi says.,Okay.
I trust him more than anybody.,All right.
"Matt Taibbi is onto something. As far as investigative reporters in particular, the way he reported the savings and loan crisis, the way he reports everything. I just listened to him above most above most. He’s my go to guy.",All right. I’ll check it out.
"Oh, his Rolling Stone articles are amazing. His stuff on the savings and loan crisis, it’s just like, “What in the fuck?” And he’s not an economist by any stretch of the imagination. So he had to really deeply embedded himself in that world to try to understand it and to be able to report on it. And with also with a humorous flare.",Now that’s nice.
Yeah.,Yeah.
Yeah.,Yeah.
"But the initial thought on this virus, the real fear was that this was going to kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, instantaneously in this country. It was going to do it very quickly if we didn’t hunker down, if we didn’t shelter in place, if we didn’t quarantine ourselves, or lock down. Do you think that the initial thought was a good idea based on the perception that this was going to be far more deadly than it turned out to be?",Maybe. I think briefly.
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,Zero.
Okay. So that’s a real statistic that’s coming from-,Yeah.
Yeah. You know those people.,Yeah. We literally run payroll.
Do you think there’s a danger of this… Yeah?,I’m like-
Same folks are there,Yeah. Still there.
Is that real?,Basically.
"Not that bad, but heart attacks, strokes-",You get hit by a bus.
Yeah. I’ve read all this stuff about them diagnosing people as a Covid death despite other variables.,This is not a question. This is what is occurring.
"Right. But this is unprecedented, right? If someone had the flu but also had a heart attack, they would assume that that person died of a heart attack.",Yes.
Yeah.,Yeah.
"…there’s a lot of, essentially… Well at least a month ago, we’re clearly in a panic. I mean, when you look around April 5th, April 6th, people were really freaking out. But here we are May, and May people are relaxing a little bit.",Yes.
It’s not what we feared. We feared something much worse.,That is correct.
"Right. It’s not as simple as just because you had COVID, covert, killed you.",Definitely not.
Right.,Yeah.
"Well, that’s what’s so weird about this.",It’s absurd.
"It’s so popular and I use that word in a weird way, but it’s so popular that we’ve kind of forgotten people die of pneumonia every day.",Yeah.
Yeah.,Not tangentially.
Right.,Not every-
"61,000 in this country last year.",Yeah. And we’re only 5% of the world.
Wow.,Yeah.
Curtains is a funny word.,"Yeah. But nobody’s, raging against Tylenol."
"Yeah. It’s weird. Acceptable deaths are weird. And that’s the slippery slope about this. People shaming people for wanting to go back to work. “And other people are going to die.” Well, if you drive, do you drive? [inaudible 01:37:40] you should stop driving because people die from driving. So you, you definitely should fill up all the swimming pools because like 50 people die every day in this country from swimming. So let’s not swim anymore.","Yeah, water is really dangerous."
We need to chop down all the coconut trees.,Stop water.
Coconuts kill 150 people every year.,Yes.
Cut down all the coconut trees. We need those people.,Yes.
"It’s, at a certain point in time, it’s… Yeah, we’re vulnerable and also, we have a finite existence no matter what.",We do. Nobody lives forever.
"I don’t read my own comments, but I do read other people’s comments. And I was reading this one little Twitter beef that was going on where someone was saying that COVID takes an average of 10 years off people’s lives and we should appreciate those 10 years. And then someone else said-",It’s not true.
I’m sure it’s not true.,Yeah definitely not.
"It’s the Twitter, it’s the world.",Oh my god.
But someone else said “The average age of people who die from COVID is older than the average age people die.”,"Let’s just say, it’s about the same."
The New York hospital said it was the number one factor for severe COVID symptoms was obesity. That was the number one factor.,"That’s correct. It is, yes, exactly."
"But it’s also, we live in a world where people want to be sensitive to other people’s feelings.","Yeah, absolutely."
So they don’t want to bring up the fact that being fat’s bad for you. It’s a judgmental on your…,Food’s great.
Yeah.,Yeah.
Yeah. Those moments of enjoying a great meal.,Yeah.
It really is. Yeah. It’s an art form as well.,"Yeah, absolutely."
"Yeah. And I think, regulated feeding windows, really the way to go, some sort of an intermittent fasting approach.",Sure.
"When I started doing that, I found myself to be quite a bit healthier. When I’ve deviated from that I’ve gained weight.",So what?
16 hours?,"Well Okay, yeah."
"Yeah. So I get to a certain point and then I count out, I usually hit the stopwatch on my phone and then I look at 15 hours, and I’m like “Oh, okay. Got an hour before I can eat.”",Yeah.
Yes.,So just try to avoid drinking and eating-
"For sure, yeah.","It’s a big deal and I think, not widely known."
Do you have time to exercise?,A little bit.
Yeah. They’re too close.,It’s too close.
"Yeah, he wants to hold off because reality-",He’s nailed it?
…is black mirror.,Oh man.
"It’s like he’s going to have to reassess and attack it from a different angle. you should try something that’s fun to do. That’s not just, like learn a martial art or something like that.",I did martial arts when I was kid. Liked it.
"Oh, alright, cool.",And Judo.
"Oh, so you really branched out.",Yeah. And did Brazilian Jujitsu briefly.
Did you? Where?,In Palo Alto.
Really?,Yeah.
"Oh no shit. I was going to suggest that. That’s a great thing for people. That’s a thing about jujitsu, if you look at it from the outside you think, “Oh bunch of meatheads strangling each other.”",Sure.
"It was what martial arts were supposed to be, when we were kids. When you saw Bruce Lee fuck-up all these big giant guys. Like, “Wow, martial arts allow you to beat someone far bigger and stronger than you.”",Right.
"Well, he definitely had some rough fights-",But he won.
"He won. Yeah. He’s a legend. But what it showed, I mean I’m a huge lover of jujitsu, what it showed is that there is a method for diffusing these situations with technique and knowledge. And I think it’s also a great way to exercise too because it’s almost like the exercise is secondary to the learning of the thing. The exercise is like you want to develop strength and conditioning just so that you could be better at doing the thing. And the analogy that I use is, imagine if you had a race car and you could actually give the race car better handling and more horsepower just from your own focus and effort. That’s really what it’s like.","Yeah, totally."
"Oh, really?",Yeah.
"Oh, that’s awesome.",[crosstalk 01:50:51]. Yeah.
It’s a great thing to learn. It really is.,"Yes, seems like a good… Yeah."
"Yeah. Maybe something like… mean even if you just have someone who holds the pads for you, you could get a workout in and it’d be fun.",Sure.
Interesting.,Now some of the-
I wanted to ask you about this before I forgot. There’s a company that’s called Apex is taking your Teslas and they’re giving it a wider base and wider tires and a little bit more advanced suspension.,Sure.
How do you feel about that?,"Sounds good to me, sure."
Do you work with them? Are you cool with those people?,"Yeah, I mean, go ahead."
They’re jazzing stuff up with carbon fiber and doing a bunch of interior choices. You’re cool with… You can’t fuck with that. You don’t have time. So is it good that someone comes along and has that sort of specialty operation?,Yeah. I’ve got no problem.
Have you seen that company’s stuff? What they do?,"I don’t know specifically, but there’s-"
"It’s pretty dope. They make it pretty dope looking… They take model S and they widen it and give it a bunch of carbon fiber. That’s it, right there.",Cool.
"Ooh-la-la, look at that.",That looks pretty nice.
I understand.,Yeah.
I understand. Last time you were here you convince me to buy a Tesla. I bought it and it’s fucking insane.,Oh great. Glad you like it.
Aw Man.,Pretty fun.
"I don’t… It’s not just pretty fun. The way I’ve described it is, it makes other cars seem stupid. They just seem dumb. And I love dumb things. I love dumb cars. Like I love campfires. I love campfires. I have a 1993 Porsche that’s air cooled.",Sure.
"But there’s something engaging about the mechanical, just like the gears and, it’s very analog. But it’s so stupid in comparison to the Tesla. Like when I want to go somewhere in the model S, I hit the gas and it just goes, whee. It just, it like violates time.",Yeah.
Oh yeah.,Yeah. Cool.
Oh Jesus.,Just like a sprinter basically.
"It’s so… I’ve taken so many people. And, I take them for the Holy shit moment. I’m like, “You ready?” like “Hang on there.” and then I stomp on the gas-",And they’ve never felt anything like it.
It’s confusing.,Yeah.
It really is.,Sure.
The instant torque and just the sheer acceleration is baffling.,It’s baffling.
It’s baffling.,They’ve never felt it.
No.,It’s faster than falling.
"It’s crazy. It’s so fast. It’s a roller coaster. And my family yells at me when I stomp the gas. Like I tell my kids, I’m like, “You want to feel it? You want to feel it?” they’re like “Do it, do it, do it.” my wife’s like, “Don’t do it.” Boom. And even if I just do it on the highway for a couple of seconds, it’s very exciting.","Yeah, pretty fun."
"Oh, but sure, well anything that goes 0 to 60, what is it 1.9? Is that the 0 to 60?",That’s the base model.
What’s the top of the food chain model?,[inaudible 00:01:57:14].
Okay. Faster than that. Let’s just say faster than that.,"Faster than that, yeah."
"That seems so crazy to me. Now, what was it like when the dude threw the steel balls at the window and they were supposed to not break, and it broke?","Well, yeah. I mean-"
Yeah. You didn’t get mad though.,No-
So in hindsight-,It didn’t go through though.
It didn’t go through.,It’s doesn’t go through.
"That’s true. It didn’t shatter the whole thing, like a regular window would either, which would just dissolve. Right? So in hindsight, the ball should have been first, sledgehammer second.",Yeah.
"You live, you learn.","Yeah, exactly."
"Listen, man, we’ve taken up a lot of your time. You had a child recently.","Yeah, I got to get back to it."
Thank you. My pleasure.,All right.
"Elon Musk, ladies and gentlemen. Good night.","Anyway, that should get a little play."
Do it Franz!,It’s a regular truck door.
Want me to do this?,Do it.
That’s some pretty hard stuff.,"Yeah, hit it a couple times."
"Yeah, you’re welcome. So on the right, that’s like normal truck doors that may as well be made of tissue paper. That looks like a paintball. Very different. So when you say something’s built tough, that’s what we mean.",What about the glass?
Love you Elon!,Seems like a vulnerability.
"So yeah, let’s talk about the… We call it the Volt. Cybertruck Volt. Let’s look… Let’s demo this active. Yeah. The rear is a hundred cubic feet, six and a half foot length, bed length, up to 3,500 pounds of payload. Yeah. And it can tow… But what about a real world test? Let’s actually have a tug of war here with an F150. So you can see which one can pull which. Let’s do the tug of war video. I mean, yeah. It was uphill.",So let’s see. On-road performance…
"All right. Yeah. So you can order now if you would like. Tesla.com/cybertruck. Or I should say also, we’re going to be offering rides in this all night. Don’t mind the glass.","Anyway, thank you guys for coming."
Thank you.,All right. Thank you.
"It’s not a science problem. It’s an engineering problem. It’s a question of if, it’s a question of when, and the team is a hundred percent focused on resolving these limiting processes as quickly as possible.",Exactly.
"Yeah. I think if you look at the expansion we’ve done in Shanghai, that factory was built in less than a year and ramped in five to six months to full volume.","That took longer than that, about a year."
"I think the human capital, the human capital growth though, of having factories here, Berlin, Shanghai, Fremont does a lot to maybe not exponentially grow, but hopefully exponentially grow.",We are exponentially growing.
"But again, it’s an engineering problem. It’s not a question of, if it’s a question of when. On the mixing side, we haven’t actually really had any challenges specific to your question. Fundamentally, we’re still happy with the dry process direction in terms of the factory footprint, complexity, utility consumption, space and overall complexities.",Yeah.
"So we took a look at customers in our backlog who have ordered FSD, did they cancel presumably to go to subscription apps or did they take delivery? And the level of cancellations there was not same cannibalization there. It’s possible that that changes, but that was also part of our pricing strategy at $99 and $199.",Yeah.
"Okay. Thank you very much for your help. And I think that’s all the time we have for today. Thanks for all your questions. And we’ll speak to you again in three months time. Have a good day, everyone.",Thank you.
Thank you very much. We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.,Okay.
Yeah. I’ll jump in here. So with respect to Dojo …,"Sorry, Zach. My apologies. I was on mute."
"Yeah. Just let me jump in on with vampire drain. That’s definitely not the issue. A good lithium ion cell self discharges, less than 0.001% of its energy per day. So it’s, vampire drain is maybe not…",As mythical as non-buyers.
Thank you. Yeah. And last question from institutional investor is master plan of part two talks about an urban transport vehicle that is smaller than traditional bus with greater aerial density achieved by removing the central aisle. Do you have any updates to share on this goal?,Not at this time.
"Hi everybody. I was hoping maybe you just first, you could talk a little bit about how you’re thinking about the rollout of version nine of SSD and the transition to the subscription model. It sounds like some, of this is about to roll out next month. I’m not sure if that’s a subscription model, but maybe you could just spend a little time talking about how impactful you expect that to be?","So I got, go ahead again. Yeah."
"Hi, good evening. Thanks, to two questions. One is on cogs. I think we’ve gotten from battery day a pretty good feel about the potential for cogs reduction related to powertrain, but I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing cogs ex powertrain. Is it still need a meaningful reduction on that front to make the math work on a $25,000 vehicle? So what levers do you have to reducing your cost X powertrain? Is it just more scale, better supplier pricing, or is it just based on ongoing cost reduction?",I think all of the above.
"Oh, all right. Thank you very much. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for today. Thank you very much for dialing in and for listening. And we’ll speak to you again in about three months. Thank you. Bye.",Thanks sir.
"Thank you very much. And the third question is, can you give us a progress update on dry coating of the battery electrodes. At the Battery Day, Elon said, “I would not say this is completely in the bag, as yet as the yields were low.”",Andrew?
"Yeah. Yeah. Agreed, Elon. And as you’ve said before, with the S-Curve of production, you can be off a little bit on the initial part of the S-Curve, and that makes a difference in absolute capacity by quite a bit, one month to the next. So, yeah, we are progressing up that S-Curve as fast as we possibly can.",Yeah. And we don’t see any showstoppers.
"Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the regulatory environment for FST and how you’re seeing that play out? Obviously, it’s a bit of a moving target right now, and you guys are leading the way here, but we’d love to understand how those conversations are going and how you see that impacting the roll out of FST throughout the balance of this year and into next year.","Okay. Zach, do you want to [inaudible 00:37:56]?"
I think it’s going to be awesome.,Yeah.
"All right. Thank you very much. And unfortunately, that’s all the time we have today, so thanks for all of your great questions, and we will speak to you again in about three months. Thank you. Thanks, Elon.",Thanks. Bye.
"Thank you, Elon. I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some opening remarks as well.",Okay. Sure.
"Thank you very much, everyone. And let’s begin with questions from say.com. The first question from retail shareholders is is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the same time as vehicle production? Can Tesla share more information on what products you’ll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?","Yeah. Drew, do you want to take that?"
Yes.,"Yeah, go ahead, Drew."
Yeah. That’s true.,"Subscale one. Yeah, so …"
"Thanks, Elon.",Welcome.
"Okay. And now I’m trying to get a sense of how next year is going to look like. So if I look at your production capacity at the end of this year, it’s going to be almost 850,000 units on an annualized basis, and you’re going to increase capacity in Shanghai, open Berlin. You say today you would open Austin as well, so you’re probably going to end the year above one million units. And so am I right thinking next year we should expect to deliver somewhere between 840,000 and one million cars during the year?","Yes. Go ahead, Zach."
"So there is no usable or efficient time wasted for charging the Semi, that’s the goal. We’re working with other parties to make sure that there is a standard infrastructure that will be able to be deployed for all customers. Probably all I can say at this point, yeah. [crosstalk 00:03:07].","Sorry, go ahead."
The technology that we’re putting in Semi is identical to what we’re putting in the other vehicles.,Yeah. Just bigger and more motors.
"Thank you very much. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for the Q and A today. Appreciate all your great questions and we’ll speak to you again in about three months. Thank you. Goodbye.",Thank you.
"Everyone. Well, I mean, this is definitely a new approach. We’ve got the Tesla drive in movie theater, basically. It’s good to see everyone. It’s a little hard to read the room with everyone being in cars, but it’s the only way we can do it. So hopefully it’s cool. And hopefully you can hear me. Can you guys hear me?",Okay. All right. Great.
"Hi, folks. That was great. We’re going to take a short break before we begin the Battery Day event, so stay tuned. If you’re local and here in the audience today, you can feel free to get out of the cars and stretch your legs, but try to stay near the cars, because we’re going to begin properly in a little bit. See you soon. (silence).",[inaudible 01:40:28].
"Hello, everyone.",Great. Should you start?
"Sure. Thanks, Elon. Hi. I’m Drew Baglino, SVP of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla, and I’m incredibly excited to talk about what we’ve been doing with batteries here at Tesla.",Great. So let’s see. You’ve got the clicker?
"Especially when it’s just a transitory one, anyway.",Yes.
We’re going to run out of these fossil fuels. Let’s just move to the future and not run this experiment any longer. Yeah.,Talk a bit louder.
You got it.,"Okay. So anyway, there is a lot of good …"
"Oh, okay.",It’s different.
Absolutely.,It’s insanely difficult to scale up. Yeah.
"When you look at the size of that factory on the previous page, it really shows how enabling all of these advancements are in achieving a three terawatt hour goal by 2030. And not only is all of that manufacturing innovation fantastic for enabling scale, it’s also an additional 18% reduction in dollar per kilowatt hour at the battery pack level.","But wait, there’s more."
"But wait, there’s more. So we have a manufacturing system, we’ve got a cell design. What are the active materials we’re going to put in that cell design? Let’s talk about the anode first. Let’s talk about silicon. Why is silicon awesome? It’s awesome because it’s the most abundant element in the Earth’s crust after oxygen, which means it’s everywhere. It’s sand.",Sand is silicon dioxide.
"The anode would cost, yeah, with this silicon, the anode costs a dollar and 20 cents a kilowatt hour.",Yeah.
"And how does it work? Start with raw metallurgical silicon, stabilize the surface with an elastic ion conducting polymer coating that is applied through a very scalable approach. No chemical vapor deposition, no highly engineered high capacity, high cap ex solutions, and then integrate it into the electrode through a robust network formed out of a highly elastic binder. And in the end, by leveraging this silicon to its potential, we can increase the range of our vehicles by an additional 20%. Just this improvement.",Yeah. It gets cheaper and longer range. Okay.
"Why increasing nickel is a goal of ours, and really everybody’s in the battery industry. But one of the reasons why cobalt is even used at all is because it is a very stable bookshelf. And the challenge with going to pure nickel is stabilizing that bookshelf with only nickel. And that’s what we’ve been working on with our high nickel cathode development, which has zero cobalt in it, leveraging novel coatings and dopants We can get a 15% reduction in cathode dollar per kilowatt hour.",Yeah. Big deal.
"And with very little energy trade-off. Just enough to have, you still want to use 100% nickel for something like a semi-truck, but really not much of a sacrifice at all.",Yeah.
Discovered today.,"Yeah, what we already know is exist."
"Simply mix clay with salt, put it in water, salt comes out with the lithium, done.",Yeah. It’s pretty crazy.
"But I think it’s important to point out that when we talked about three terawatt hours by 2030, the problem is a 20 terawatt hour problem. So everybody needs to be accelerating their efforts to accomplish these objectives. It doesn’t matter where you are in the value chain. There is a ton to do, you need to rethink from first principles how you do it, so that you can scale to meet all of our objectives.",Yep.
"And, Elon.",Sure.
Absolutely.,So we’ll invite a few people on stage.
"Oh, there are mics. Wait for the mic.","Oh, there are mics. Okay, great, great."
"Thinking long-term, is there any other segments that this new battery will be able to disrupt or electrify, beyond just the initial Model 2 or cheaper sedan? Like a Boring Company loop, plane-",Where are you? Are you there?
"I think the key is to be smart about your chemistry choices, your materials choices.",Talk louder.
"How have the technology advancements and increased vertical integration of battery manufacturing, influenced your ability to improve the environmental and social impact of the supply chain? And I think … Yeah.",We sort of have said that already.
Covered that. That one.,We literally just answered that.
Sure. I just want to reiterate the fact that this is a massive problem.,Massive problem.
"I’m Scott, I focus on cell design. I think it’s hard to put into words how inspiring this is, been at it such a long time with Tesla. And I really hope others do join us-",Since when Scott?
Yeah. I think the focus for us is increasing CapEx efficiency. This is something that we’ve been working very hard for the past three years. You can see that we can build new factories for less amount of money and much faster.,Yeah.
We want more people.,Yes. We love it. We do.
"Thank you very much. The last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?","Well, right now, zero. But longterm, a lot."
Our biggest property.,Yeah. It’s the biggest property. True.
"Yeah. I think the Megapack has represented itself and is an integrated rapidly deployable grid type storage battery of megawatt hour scale. We’re working with utilities large and small, not just utilities, but also just micro grid and project developers of all types and building our own projects where it makes sense. There’s a lot of demand for the product and we’re growing the production rates as fast as we can for that product. Then on Autobidder, Autobidder is basically autopilot for grid tied batteries. It’s an autonomous energy market participation system that does high frequency trading and ensures-",That’s a bad word.
… frequency trading-,That’s a bad word.
"Yeah, centrally or distributed, it does both.",Yeah.
Thank you. The next question on insurance. What is the holdup on Tesla Insurance outside of California? Will you release numbers from that part of the business? Will Tesla Insurance be required to participate in the Tesla ride hailing network as a driver?,Sure.
"Currently, we have a product in California, as I’ve described before, it’s been quite well received. And I would largely describe it as a fairly standard insurance product with elements of it that are unique to our cars. So you can think of it as a Version 1 of Tesla Insurance.",Version 0.9 [inaudible 00:39:13] at least.
"No, that’s straightforward enough. I think just adding to what you said earlier about talent and people.",Yeah.
The same goes in all areas of cell.,Yes.
Okay. Thank you very much for everyone for joining this call and thank you for all your good questions. And we’ll speak to you again in about three months.,Yeah. Have you seen her with [inaudible 00:14:46].
"… of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease will be the least expensive way on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value with time.",Yeah.
"Yeah, I agree with that, Elon. The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think is great. The other one that I would add is it’s always been our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make that as digital as possible.",Yeah. Touchless delivery.
"Yeah, use it as a heat source if you need it instead of the outdoors when the outdoors is really cold.",Yeah.
"Thanks everybody. I hope everyone’s safe and healthy. I got one question; one follow-up. And I’ll point out, I’ve had a root canal before. And I would agree Elon, it was less painful than buying a car.","Exactly. I mean, it really is… Yeah, exactly."
"Yeah. It’s a big problem, actually. It’s a big problem.",It’s crazy. Yes.
"Hi. Good evening. Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is already positive at such low volume. How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model 3? What other factors should we think about and what does that mean for the ampler, for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?",Zach?
"Thank you. Now, second question from retail shareholders is: Will you release the Tesla ride-hailing network app before full autonomy and change the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be drivers on the network? If so, when will this happen? Might want to target California airports first, also a good place to add Superchargers.","Sorry, that sounds like more question than one."
"Yeah, thank you. The next question from retail investors is: How many California owners are currently insured with Tesla Insurance? What’s the target for Tesla Insurance in 2020? When will you start to significantly leverage the data you have from the fleet to lower the cost of your coverage? Will we get premium discount of certain percent?","Yeah, I mean, go ahead, Zach."
The last part of the question was will there be a discount for using autopilot with our cars?,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There will be."
"Okay. Now let’s switch to institutional shareholder questions. The number one question is, “You have spoken previously about Shanghai Giga being 65% lower CapEx per unit of capacity. Have you learned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective? If yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the longterm gross margin?”","Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead."
Also on working capital.,"Yeah, absolutely."
"No, I completely agree with that. I think some of our learnings during the Model 3 launch period, where we grew too quickly and with too much complexity, and it held back our ability to continue to scale. Part of the journey that we’ve been on in 2019 is to unwind a series of unintentional bad processes that kind of accumulated in the company over time. That’s kind of what contributes to the reduction in OpEx over the year as we get smarter about that. Now we’ve laid a good foundation, I think. I agree with Elon that we’re not holding back on the growth. I mean, we have two vehicle products launching right now. That will consume much of the bandwidth of the company to stabilize those over the course of the year. Then looking into next year we have even more products launching, more factories.",Right. Yeah.
We want to be smart about how we spend money and grow in a way that’s sustainable so we don’t fall victim to the mistakes I think we made a year and a half or so ago.,"Yeah, absolutely."
That’s true.,Yeah.
The existing cars.,Huh?
The existing cars.,"Yeah, the existing cars that are being made."
I think we always find ways to become more CapEx efficient per unit of capacity.,"Yes, exactly. Yes."
We challenge the teams to always become more efficient. We see a reduction per unit in term of CapEx.,Absolutely.
"And just to add to that, I think it’s important to keep the Model Y launch in context of the next 18 to 24 months. What we’re working on here between Berlin and Shanghai and Fremont is to have 3 and Y locally produced in all locations, and so Model 3 is expanding as Model Y is expanding. There may be ups and downs in various factories as we get to the journey of having these products on all the major continents.",Yeah.
"No, I think that’s very fair.",Yeah.
"I would just say the focus is on costs on the powertrain. One more thing about technology innovations, it’s how do we continue to drive the cost down?",Yeah.
"And that’s through voltages. Maybe one angle, but there are certainly others that just enable more power density and lower cost.","Upside? Powertrain is mind blowing, I think. Yeah."
I shall have to read the blogs more. Thank you.,"All right, you’re welcome."
"Thank you very much for everyone, for all of your good questions, and we will speak to you in another three months. Thank you.",Thank you.
" It is Halloween night, and I have gotten my treat, which I’ve been asking for a while. I’m here with Elon Musk at the headquarters of Tesla. Is that right? The right pronounce? Is it Tesla or Tezla?"," Tesla, yeah. "
Whatever. ,"By the way, I think your costume is great."
"I’m here with delicious coffee. We are gonna have a long discussion about all kinds of things. Elon’s been very nice to do this in the evening, here. We’ve been chatting about all kinds of things, but we’re gonna get into it really quick. We’re gonna talk about Tesla, we’re gonna talk about SpaceX, we’re gonna talk about this year, we’re gonna talk about The Boring Company, and anything else Elon wants to talk about, because people like to hear you talk. ",Using Twitter without a filter
"Let’s start from the beginning, about this year. You’ve given some very interesting interviews. You’ve gotten on Twitter, made some mistakes.",What’s Twitter?
"What’s Twitter? Okay, let’s start with Twitter. I have an obsession with Twitter, too, and an addiction. How do you look at that with you? What is going on?",What’s going on? 
And sometimes ...,Yeah. It’s pretty random. 
What about the things they didn’t love? Are you under strict orders not to do that? Is that correct? Will you be? Will you have to change your Twitter behavior?,Not really. 
"Under the recent settlement, you don’t have to be careful about what you tweet? If it’s anime, that’s one thing.",Mm-hmm.
That’s about it. So you can’t do that.,"Without somebody getting mad, no. "
"All right. But when you do it in ... I’m not going to get to the SEC ‘cause I understand you can’t talk about that very much. Nothing to do with that. Although you did tweak them in one of your tweets, but at some point that will stop. Correct?",What did I say?
"You made some remark. Elon, there’s so many tweets that you do that are so obnoxious, it’s hard to know. That was an obnoxious tweet.",It was?
"Yes, it was.",Oh. 
Don’t do that. ,I was just ... I forgot which one it was.
"Yeah, but —",Can you remind me?
"No. It’s like you had some name ... Look it, you’re cackling on Halloween! ",Picking fights with the press
Do you understand —,They’re terrible. 
Do you hear — understand the mood in this country ...,Terrible people.
Okay. But I’m asking if you understand where it goes to.,"Yes, of course I do."
"What about what Donald Trump does, about “enemy of the people”? Do you look at it that way?",No. 
Do you take criticism to heart correctly?,Yes.
Give me an example of something if you could.,How do you think rockets get to orbit?
Right. And therefore?,I have a strong interest in the truth. 
All right. And you are —,Much more than journalists do. 
"What I’m trying to get to is, do you want to acknowledge when you do this it does set off ... People beyond you that listen to you, you have a fan base that’s quite rabid, I would say.","No, I wouldn’t say that. "
No? ,I think they’re great. 
All of them?,"No, not all of them. "
Right. Okay. ,The “excruciating” year of 2018
"Let’s talk about this year. What has gone on this year with you? It’s a very roller-coaster year. How would you explain it? You did a very emotional interview in the New York Times, and I promise we’ll get to Tesla and all the other things we want to talk about, but what has happened to you this year? How would you put it?",It’s been a very difficult year. 
And?,Excruciating.
"So, the pressure of doing this. ",Yes. 
Why is it that you do this?,It’s trivial to start a car company.
Absolutely. ,It is insanely difficult to make it successful. 
"You put too much pressure on yourself this year, or it just is what you’re doing?",It sounds like you’re not hearing me. 
"I’m hearing you. I understand it’s incredibly difficult. What I’m saying is why did you do it this way, this year?",You’re definitely not understanding me.
What do you credit that to?,Excruciating effort. 
By you and —,Hundred-hour weeks by everyone. 
By everyone here at Tesla. ,Yes. There wasn’t some other way to do this. 
That’s what I’m saying —,"There wasn’t some other way to do this, Kara. "
While you’re also running a space company and other ones. ,Yes.
Yes.,Why does Musk push himself so hard?
100 percent.,Yeah. Into electric cars. They’ve said so. 
I do not. I have a —,Shame on you.
Ford Fiesta. ,Okay.
"No, I would think, too —",I’m really car-shaming you.
No. I don’t drive my car very much. It sits in the garage. I try not to drive my car at all.,Driving something. 
"Yes. I think it’s probably fair to say that Tesla has advanced sustainable energy by at least five years, conservatively, and maybe closer to 10, and then if we continue to make progress, we might advance it by 20 years. This could be all the difference in the world. ",The toll on Musk and Tesla’s employees
"Then if you don’t actually make those cars, you still have all the costs. It’s like a flotilla of supertankers. The inertia of that is incredible. If anything happens to stall out the production progress, and that could be any one of those 10,000 suppliers, or on the order of 10,000 internal processes, if any of those is slow or wrong or whatever, you can’t make cars. You only need one missing thing, and whatever the slowest, least lucky part of the production process is, that sets your rate. ",Self-inflicted wounds and sleep deprivation
So why do you do that?,It’s not intentional. 
"And you had talked in the New York Times about using Ambien and stuff like that. That was to regulate your sleep, correct? ",Yeah. It’s not like for fun or something. 
"Now you’re to 80 hours, so it’s like totally manageable in that regard. ","Yeah, 80 or 90 ..."
You’re just like a regular lawyer in that regard. What is that? I think I’m about 80. I think I’m probably about —,Yeah. 80 is pretty sustainable. 
Yeah. The pain level for hours increases exponentially. It’s like nonlinear above 80. ,Tesla’s first profitable quarter in two years
"Our cars are constantly being updated with new technology, so we don’t really have a model year like other car companies. As soon as we come up with some improvement, we just roll it into production. ",Self-driving cars
Talk about the new navigation feature. ,Drive on Navigation?
"Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing. ",Government regulation
Is where you’re gonna rely on it.,"Yeah, they’re like the regulator of cars, really."
"Yeah, they’re like the regulator of cars, really.",Tesla’s competitors
"Now other competitors, I’d love you to sort of assess the competitive landscape. Faraday just lost another founder today, which was the hot company, or the allegedly hot company, I think that’s probably easier to say it that way. Lucid got a billion dollars from SoftBank.","Saudi Arabia, not SoftBank."
Right. ,Like you can lose races because of that.
So none of the car companies. None of the car companies. ,No.
"So all I’m getting at, is you don’t think any of the rivals will come close. Any of the ones that are touting their solutions?","I would say close to zero percent, probably."
"Okay. All right, that’s not close. That’s not close at all.",Yeah.
Okay.,This is my honest ... This is —
"This is just my ... what I think. I mean, I’m not ... it’s not like ... I could be wrong, but this is what I think.",Why Tesla is not going private after all
"All right. So the challenge you face is financial, though. Getting funding and stuff like that. And you’ve gotten ... Saudis had bought a big bunch of your stock, that’s just separate, they —","They might have sold it, I don’t know."
All quarters going forward. So do you need more investment?,No.
Not at all.,I don’t think so.
"Okay, all right. Okay. All right. Okay.",I think that’s like probably even less than that.
"Right. Do you believe you have enough investment? Even if it’s cash-flow positive, you wanna invest more. Correct? Do you believe, do you think you need more investment?",No.
No. That you can do it based on selling these cars?,Yes.
"Okay. All right, so last thing on this, on Tesla, these new products. The truck, the Roadster, where are they?","Yeah, I’m super-excited about the future —"
Do you have another thing you’re making?,Ha-ha. We definitely do.
Do you have a vertical lift and takeoff?,"The supersonic VTOL jet, electric jet."
"Yeah. Perhaps a hovercraft like Larry Page, I don’t know.","No, hovercrafts are pretty straightforward."
"Yeah. Okay, sure.",But —
Do you have something special —,Yeah.
"Yeah, such as?",It’s great. 
It’s great? It’s in your head?,Yeah.
"Okay, all right.","I mean, I wrote down some of it, but ... "
But the truck is more immediate?,There were like a few things —
"When do those come online? That was a very dramatic opening of bringing it in, by the way. People are obsessed with your jackets, but it actually was the event that you did, where you showed it off.",Nice jacket.
"Yeah, nice jacket.",“Who are you wearing?”
Okay. All right.,"It’s not, like, accidentally. It’s that’s how —"
"OK, what does that mean?","It’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna be amazing."
"Titanium, okay. What else?","There’s like, you’ll see. It’s like ..."
It’s quite high.,It’s 25 times higher.
"Yeah, my brother is a doctor. He calls them donor-mobiles, actually.",Yeah. Like organ donors. 
But not gonna make one? Not making a Tesla motorcycle?,"Yeah, then I almost got killed ... "
Bad memories.,A truck knocked ... I got hit by a truck.
What about a plane?,Literally got hit by a truck.
I agree. You’d be surprised to know I do have a solar roof. And have had one for 10 years.,Oh cool. Great. Thank you. Good.
Yes.,So we have that. We’ve like kind of a regular —
This is tiles. This is the tile —,This is integrated with the roof.
This is within the homes?,"I can’t talk more about it, but there’s —"
"Okay, all right. So, a Roadster. Any planes?",No plans to make planes at Tesla.
No plans to make planes at Tesla.,SpaceX and dying on Mars
"All right. Well let’s get to rockets then. SpaceX. Last time we talked, you said you wanted to die on Mars, just not on landing. Which was a very funny joke, although it’s probably not a joke, it’s probably —","Well, it’d be ironic if that had happened."
"Yeah, that’s kind of the way it should go, right?",Yeah.
Yeah. “This is how Elon Musk must die!”,"Reality, yes."
“He must die in landing on Mars.”,It might happen.
"No, that’s not entertaining.",Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Right, right. That’s true. Okay. All right. Okay. Let’s start ... instead of discussing your death, your impending doom, let’s discuss what’s going on at SpaceX, which has had a more, a smoother ride, so to speak, of what you’re all doing with the rockets. You’re gonna do an astronaut? What are some of the things you’re doing?","Yes. Yeah, so this year’s been great for SpaceX."
"Well it feels stunty, come on. You’re launching a —",It’s ... I’m trying to ...
"Yes, exactly. Okay.",That’s pretty entertaining.
Anything really weird you stuck in there you didn’t tell anybody about?,No.
Right. Not creative in any way.,Super-boring.
Okay. All right. Okay.,"Yeah, that’s pretty fun."
And you caught it?,"No. No. We missed, unfortunately."
"Okay, all right.",But we get close. We got close.
All right. Where is this boat?,I think it’s moored in L.A. or something.
All right. It just floats around and catches nose cones?,"Yeah, yeah. It’s a boat with a giant net."
Okay.,And it sort of —
"What’s the net made out of? Metal, right?","No, I think, like, nylon or Kevlar."
"Which has been some years, right?",2010 or something like that?
But I do think it will become obvious over time that a Space Force is a sensible thing to do.,Going to Mars
"All right. And, Mars. Last time we talked it was 2024, was it? That you talked about getting there?","Yeah, we’re still aiming for 2024."
Try to do this?,Yes.
"Okay, the Big Falcon. What is the other thing you want to call it? Big Fucking Rocket, what?",It’s a Rorschach test.
"To Mars, or wherever.",Yeah.
Yeah.,"Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin and Amazon"
"He does, he seems to be.","He seems, he’s got some spare —"
He’s got some cash.,"Some spare change in the couch, I think."
"You’re not buying a newspaper, are you?","No, I don’t generally acquire things."
"It is, it is. Benioff bought one, but ... yeah.","Yeah, yeah, totally."
What would you buy if you could?,"Wait, is there something you think I should buy?"
"I don’t know, what do you want to buy?","I mean, do you have any suggestions?"
"I don’t know ... I was just interviewing the publisher of the New York Times and I said, “Would you like a billion dollars from one of these people?” He didn’t want it, I found that unusual. Think of the things you could do with a billion dollars.",Don’t know.
"So let’s finish up the last two things. Boring Company, I was just with Eric Garcetti in Los Angeles —","Oh, great, yeah. Eric’s been a —"
He’s a big fan.,"Yeah, Eric’s been a great supporter."
"So you’re thinking all around, lots of roads within the tunnels?","Yeah, many levels of tunnels, so —"
"It’s good, I use it.",Is it good?
"Do you say that? Please don’t do that, you need to stop. Is that how you amuse yourself?","Yeah, yeah, no, I’ve got a million of ’em."
“Digging in?”,Tunnels are really so underappreciated.
"They are, okay. All right, okay.",They have no place to go but down.
"Oh my god. All right, okay. These are dad jokes, you know that?","I am a dad, so —"
"I get that, but —","Yeah, totally. So —"
"That’s obvious. So, tunnels!","Yes, tunnels. So, the —"
How else would you get the dirt out?,"Oh, well, we’d just use an electric car."
"Right, so when are these happening? When is this ... when will one be useful? The Hawthorne one? The test tunnel, it’s a test tunnel?","Yeah, we’re about to finish the first test tunnel."
"Right, to put this in? To put this in. So, I’m going to finish up —","It’s one-way, admittedly, but —"
"On December 10th, six weeks?",Yeah.
And what’s gonna go through there?,"Yeah, you wanna come?"
"Sure, I’ll come.","Yeah, this’ll be a very one-dimensional party."

That is bad.,"That was really bad, it was really —"
Let me ask about the Saudis first. Would you take their money now?,"I think we probably would not, yes."
It’s their ruler.,Sure.
"It’s their ruler, it’s the guy who runs everything.","They didn’t elect him, you know?"
"No, no, I’m just talking about the people who have the money.","I think there are serious issues, it’s not good."
You think that — do you see that happening?,I do not.
"There is a very strong concentration of AI power, and especially at Google/DeepMind. And I have very high regard for Larry Page and Demis Hassabis, but I do think that there’s value to some independent oversight.",How is Musk feeling about the future?
"Okay, but you did say there was a chance that we are still in a ... Last time we talked —","I said, “What appears to be reality.”"
Why are you feeling that?,My current gut feel is weirdly optimistic.
"Because, given this polarization?","I don’t know, don’t know."
"Does this polarization affect you? You’ve pulled yourself off the Trump councils, I know you and I talked about whether ... I said you shouldn’t go ’cause he was gonna screw you, remember? We had a whole —","Well, you were right."
"Yes, I know you did. I think I called you, I think I said, “You’re not Jesus, it’s not going to work.”",I definitely do not think I am Jesus.
"Right, would you do it again?","Do you mean now, or ...?"
Yeah.,"I don’t know, are there councils?"
"Mm-hmm, whatever. Don’t, don’t.","Yeah, but —"
You’ll miss a letter.,"Totally. I’m like, “Do I have all the letters?”"

I don’t know why you do it.,Yes.
"Yeah, do you want to say you’re sorry? No. You can if you want.",I’m sorry to some journalists.
"Okay, I’ll give you that, I’ll give you that. Okay, I’ll give you that. Elon, podcast secured.","Thank you, Kara. It was great to see you."
"Thank you so much, I appreciate it. You kept your promise. Elon and I have been emailing about this, and you do keep your promise compared to a lot of other people, and I appreciate it.","Always, it was great to see you."
"Always, it was great to see you.",Why Tesla won’t make a scooter
"It’s been a really fascinating discussion, and I will think about buying an electric car, probably not. I’m not going to try to —","I mean, why not?"
"I love the scooter, no, get on the scooter.",It lacks dignity.
"No, it doesn’t lack dignity.",Yes they do.
"They don’t lack dignity, what are you talking about?",Have you tried driving one of those things? They —
"Yes, I do it all the time, I look fantastic.","They do not, you are laboring under an illusion."
"I truly do. Well, I think I look good, and therefore —",This is an illusion.
“It lacks dignity.”,It lacks dignity.
"That was a pleasure, thank you. It was good to see you.",

"It is Halloween night, and I have gotten my treat, which I’ve been asking for a while. I’m here with Elon Musk at the headquarters of Tesla. Is that right? The right pronounce? Is it Tesla or Tezla?","Tesla, yeah."
Whatever.,"By the way, I think your costume is great."
"I’m here with delicious coffee. We are gonna have a long discussion about all kinds of things. Elon’s been very nice to do this in the evening, here. We’ve been chatting about all kinds of things, but we’re gonna get into it really quick. We’re gonna talk about Tesla, we’re gonna talk about SpaceX, we’re gonna talk about this year, we’re gonna talk about The Boring Company, and anything else Elon wants to talk about, because people like to hear you talk.",Using Twitter without a filter
"Let’s start from the beginning, about this year. You’ve given some very interesting interviews. You’ve gotten on Twitter, made some mistakes.",What’s Twitter?
"What’s Twitter? Okay, let’s start with Twitter. I have an obsession with Twitter, too, and an addiction. How do you look at that with you? What is going on?",What’s going on?
And sometimes ...,Yeah. It’s pretty random.
What about the things they didn’t love? Are you under strict orders not to do that? Is that correct? Will you be? Will you have to change your Twitter behavior?,Not really.
"Under the recent settlement, you don’t have to be careful about what you tweet? If it’s anime, that’s one thing.",Mm-hmm.
That’s about it. So you can’t do that.,"Without somebody getting mad, no."
"All right. But when you do it in ... I’m not going to get to the SEC ‘cause I understand you can’t talk about that very much. Nothing to do with that. Although you did tweak them in one of your tweets, but at some point that will stop. Correct?",What did I say?
"You made some remark. Elon, there’s so many tweets that you do that are so obnoxious, it’s hard to know. That was an obnoxious tweet.",It was?
"Yes, it was.",Oh.
Don’t do that.,I was just ... I forgot which one it was.
"Yeah, but —",Can you remind me?
"No. It’s like you had some name ... Look it, you’re cackling on Halloween!",Picking fights with the press
Do you understand —,They’re terrible.
Do you hear — understand the mood in this country ...,Terrible people.
Okay. But I’m asking if you understand where it goes to.,"Yes, of course I do."
"What about what Donald Trump does, about “enemy of the people”? Do you look at it that way?",No.
Do you take criticism to heart correctly?,Yes.
Give me an example of something if you could.,How do you think rockets get to orbit?
Right. And therefore?,I have a strong interest in the truth.
All right. And you are —,Much more than journalists do.
"What I’m trying to get to is, do you want to acknowledge when you do this it does set off ... People beyond you that listen to you, you have a fan base that’s quite rabid, I would say.","No, I wouldn’t say that."
No?,I think they’re great.
All of them?,"No, not all of them."
Right. Okay.,The “excruciating” year of 2018
"Let’s talk about this year. What has gone on this year with you? It’s a very roller-coaster year. How would you explain it? You did a very emotional interview in the New York Times, and I promise we’ll get to Tesla and all the other things we want to talk about, but what has happened to you this year? How would you put it?",It’s been a very difficult year.
And?,Excruciating.
"So, the pressure of doing this.",Yes.
Why is it that you do this?,It’s trivial to start a car company.
Absolutely.,It is insanely difficult to make it successful.
"You put too much pressure on yourself this year, or it just is what you’re doing?",It sounds like you’re not hearing me.
"I’m hearing you. I understand it’s incredibly difficult. What I’m saying is why did you do it this way, this year?",You’re definitely not understanding me.
What do you credit that to?,Excruciating effort.
By you and —,Hundred-hour weeks by everyone.
By everyone here at Tesla.,Yes. There wasn’t some other way to do this.
That’s what I’m saying —,"There wasn’t some other way to do this, Kara."
While you’re also running a space company and other ones.,Yes.
Yes.,Why does Musk push himself so hard?
100 percent.,Yeah. Into electric cars. They’ve said so.
I do not. I have a —,Shame on you.
Ford Fiesta.,Okay.
"No, I would think, too —",I’m really car-shaming you.
No. I don’t drive my car very much. It sits in the garage. I try not to drive my car at all.,Driving something.
"Yes. I think it’s probably fair to say that Tesla has advanced sustainable energy by at least five years, conservatively, and maybe closer to 10, and then if we continue to make progress, we might advance it by 20 years. This could be all the difference in the world.",The toll on Musk and Tesla’s employees
"Then if you don’t actually make those cars, you still have all the costs. It’s like a flotilla of supertankers. The inertia of that is incredible. If anything happens to stall out the production progress, and that could be any one of those 10,000 suppliers, or on the order of 10,000 internal processes, if any of those is slow or wrong or whatever, you can’t make cars. You only need one missing thing, and whatever the slowest, least lucky part of the production process is, that sets your rate.",Self-inflicted wounds and sleep deprivation
So why do you do that?,It’s not intentional.
"And you had talked in the New York Times about using Ambien and stuff like that. That was to regulate your sleep, correct?",Yeah. It’s not like for fun or something.
"Now you’re to 80 hours, so it’s like totally manageable in that regard.","Yeah, 80 or 90 ..."
You’re just like a regular lawyer in that regard. What is that? I think I’m about 80. I think I’m probably about —,Yeah. 80 is pretty sustainable.
Yeah. The pain level for hours increases exponentially. It’s like nonlinear above 80.,Tesla’s first profitable quarter in two years
"Our cars are constantly being updated with new technology, so we don’t really have a model year like other car companies. As soon as we come up with some improvement, we just roll it into production.",Self-driving cars
Talk about the new navigation feature.,Drive on Navigation?
"Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing.",Government regulation
Is where you’re gonna rely on it.,"Yeah, they’re like the regulator of cars, really."
"Yeah, they’re like the regulator of cars, really.",Tesla’s competitors
"Now other competitors, I’d love you to sort of assess the competitive landscape. Faraday just lost another founder today, which was the hot company, or the allegedly hot company, I think that’s probably easier to say it that way. Lucid got a billion dollars from SoftBank.","Saudi Arabia, not SoftBank."
Right.,Like you can lose races because of that.
So none of the car companies. None of the car companies.,No.
"So all I’m getting at, is you don’t think any of the rivals will come close. Any of the ones that are touting their solutions?","I would say close to zero percent, probably."
"Okay. All right, that’s not close. That’s not close at all.",Yeah.
Okay.,This is my honest ... This is —
"This is just my ... what I think. I mean, I’m not ... it’s not like ... I could be wrong, but this is what I think.",Why Tesla is not going private after all
"All right. So the challenge you face is financial, though. Getting funding and stuff like that. And you’ve gotten ... Saudis had bought a big bunch of your stock, that’s just separate, they —","They might have sold it, I don’t know."
All quarters going forward. So do you need more investment?,No.
Not at all.,I don’t think so.
"Okay, all right. Okay. All right. Okay.",I think that’s like probably even less than that.
"Right. Do you believe you have enough investment? Even if it’s cash-flow positive, you wanna invest more. Correct? Do you believe, do you think you need more investment?",No.
No. That you can do it based on selling these cars?,Yes.
"Okay. All right, so last thing on this, on Tesla, these new products. The truck, the Roadster, where are they?","Yeah, I’m super-excited about the future —"
Do you have another thing you’re making?,Ha-ha. We definitely do.
Do you have a vertical lift and takeoff?,"The supersonic VTOL jet, electric jet."
"Yeah. Perhaps a hovercraft like Larry Page, I don’t know.","No, hovercrafts are pretty straightforward."
"Yeah. Okay, sure.",But —
Do you have something special —,Yeah.
"Yeah, such as?",It’s great.
It’s great? It’s in your head?,Yeah.
"Okay, all right.","I mean, I wrote down some of it, but ..."
But the truck is more immediate?,There were like a few things —
"When do those come online? That was a very dramatic opening of bringing it in, by the way. People are obsessed with your jackets, but it actually was the event that you did, where you showed it off.",Nice jacket.
"Yeah, nice jacket.",“Who are you wearing?”
Okay. All right.,"It’s not, like, accidentally. It’s that’s how —"
"OK, what does that mean?","It’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna be amazing."
"Titanium, okay. What else?","There’s like, you’ll see. It’s like ..."
It’s quite high.,It’s 25 times higher.
"Yeah, my brother is a doctor. He calls them donor-mobiles, actually.",Yeah. Like organ donors.
But not gonna make one? Not making a Tesla motorcycle?,"Yeah, then I almost got killed ..."
Bad memories.,A truck knocked ... I got hit by a truck.
What about a plane?,Literally got hit by a truck.
I agree. You’d be surprised to know I do have a solar roof. And have had one for 10 years.,Oh cool. Great. Thank you. Good.
Yes.,So we have that. We’ve like kind of a regular —
This is tiles. This is the tile —,This is integrated with the roof.
This is within the homes?,"I can’t talk more about it, but there’s —"
"Okay, all right. So, a Roadster. Any planes?",No plans to make planes at Tesla.
No plans to make planes at Tesla.,SpaceX and dying on Mars
"All right. Well let’s get to rockets then. SpaceX. Last time we talked, you said you wanted to die on Mars, just not on landing. Which was a very funny joke, although it’s probably not a joke, it’s probably —","Well, it’d be ironic if that had happened."
"Yeah, that’s kind of the way it should go, right?",Yeah.
Yeah. “This is how Elon Musk must die!”,"Reality, yes."
“He must die in landing on Mars.”,It might happen.
"No, that’s not entertaining.",Yeah. Yeah.
"Yeah. Right, right. That’s true. Okay. All right. Okay. Let’s start ... instead of discussing your death, your impending doom, let’s discuss what’s going on at SpaceX, which has had a more, a smoother ride, so to speak, of what you’re all doing with the rockets. You’re gonna do an astronaut? What are some of the things you’re doing?","Yes. Yeah, so this year’s been great for SpaceX."
"Well it feels stunty, come on. You’re launching a —",It’s ... I’m trying to ...
"Yes, exactly. Okay.",That’s pretty entertaining.
Anything really weird you stuck in there you didn’t tell anybody about?,No.
Right. Not creative in any way.,Super-boring.
Okay. All right. Okay.,"Yeah, that’s pretty fun."
And you caught it?,"No. No. We missed, unfortunately."
"Okay, all right.",But we get close. We got close.
All right. Where is this boat?,I think it’s moored in L.A. or something.
All right. It just floats around and catches nose cones?,"Yeah, yeah. It’s a boat with a giant net."
Okay.,And it sort of —
"What’s the net made out of? Metal, right?","No, I think, like, nylon or Kevlar."
"Which has been some years, right?",2010 or something like that?
But I do think it will become obvious over time that a Space Force is a sensible thing to do.,Going to Mars
"All right. And, Mars. Last time we talked it was 2024, was it? That you talked about getting there?","Yeah, we’re still aiming for 2024."
Try to do this?,Yes.
"Okay, the Big Falcon. What is the other thing you want to call it? Big Fucking Rocket, what?",It’s a Rorschach test.
"To Mars, or wherever.",Yeah.
Yeah.,"Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin and Amazon"
"He does, he seems to be.","He seems, he’s got some spare —"
He’s got some cash.,"Some spare change in the couch, I think."
"You’re not buying a newspaper, are you?","No, I don’t generally acquire things."
"It is, it is. Benioff bought one, but ... yeah.","Yeah, yeah, totally."
What would you buy if you could?,"Wait, is there something you think I should buy?"
"I don’t know, what do you want to buy?","I mean, do you have any suggestions?"
"I don’t know ... I was just interviewing the publisher of the New York Times and I said, “Would you like a billion dollars from one of these people?” He didn’t want it, I found that unusual. Think of the things you could do with a billion dollars.",Don’t know.
"So let’s finish up the last two things. Boring Company, I was just with Eric Garcetti in Los Angeles —","Oh, great, yeah. Eric’s been a —"
He’s a big fan.,"Yeah, Eric’s been a great supporter."
"So you’re thinking all around, lots of roads within the tunnels?","Yeah, many levels of tunnels, so —"
"It’s good, I use it.",Is it good?
"Do you say that? Please don’t do that, you need to stop. Is that how you amuse yourself?","Yeah, yeah, no, I’ve got a million of ’em."
“Digging in?”,Tunnels are really so underappreciated.
"They are, okay. All right, okay.",They have no place to go but down.
"Oh my god. All right, okay. These are dad jokes, you know that?","I am a dad, so —"
"I get that, but —","Yeah, totally. So —"
"That’s obvious. So, tunnels!","Yes, tunnels. So, the —"
How else would you get the dirt out?,"Oh, well, we’d just use an electric car."
"Right, so when are these happening? When is this ... when will one be useful? The Hawthorne one? The test tunnel, it’s a test tunnel?","Yeah, we’re about to finish the first test tunnel."
"Right, to put this in? To put this in. So, I’m going to finish up —","It’s one-way, admittedly, but —"
"On December 10th, six weeks?",Yeah.
And what’s gonna go through there?,"Yeah, you wanna come?"
"Sure, I’ll come.","Yeah, this’ll be a very one-dimensional party."
"It’s the day before my birthday, that would be great. That would be great, or something. One-dimensional party, very funny, very funny.","Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi investors and techlash"
That is bad.,"That was really bad, it was really —"
Let me ask about the Saudis first. Would you take their money now?,"I think we probably would not, yes."
It’s their ruler.,Sure.
"It’s their ruler, it’s the guy who runs everything.","They didn’t elect him, you know?"
"No, no, I’m just talking about the people who have the money.","I think there are serious issues, it’s not good."
You think that — do you see that happening?,I do not.
"There is a very strong concentration of AI power, and especially at Google/DeepMind. And I have very high regard for Larry Page and Demis Hassabis, but I do think that there’s value to some independent oversight.",How is Musk feeling about the future?
"Okay, but you did say there was a chance that we are still in a ... Last time we talked —","I said, “What appears to be reality.”"
Why are you feeling that?,My current gut feel is weirdly optimistic.
"Because, given this polarization?","I don’t know, don’t know."
"Does this polarization affect you? You’ve pulled yourself off the Trump councils, I know you and I talked about whether ... I said you shouldn’t go ’cause he was gonna screw you, remember? We had a whole —","Well, you were right."
"Yes, I know you did. I think I called you, I think I said, “You’re not Jesus, it’s not going to work.”",I definitely do not think I am Jesus.
"Right, would you do it again?","Do you mean now, or ...?"
Yeah.,"I don’t know, are there councils?"
"Mm-hmm, whatever. Don’t, don’t.","Yeah, but —"
You’ll miss a letter.,"Totally. I’m like, “Do I have all the letters?”"
"Totally. I’m like, “Do I have all the letters?”","There’s a new letter, no there’s a new one."
"Yes, you’ve been very supportive.","Yeah, absolutely."
"The earbuds make me very happy, I don’t know why.",The ones without the cable?
"Without the cable, I love them. I look terrible, I love them. You know, the earbuds [AirPods]?","Yeah, the one without the cable?"
Yeah.,Yeah.
"Right, okay, my last question. If you had to redo anything this year, Elon, what would it be? Besides your ... apparently, you did sumo wrestling? Obviously that’s one of —",That was five years ago.
"Okay, all right.",My back still hurts.
I don’t know why you do it.,Yes.
"Yeah, do you want to say you’re sorry? No. You can if you want.",I’m sorry to some journalists.
"Okay, I’ll give you that, I’ll give you that. Okay, I’ll give you that. Elon, podcast secured.","Thank you, Kara. It was great to see you."
