You will know for the rest of this child’s life, you were born during a weird time."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 10, "phrase": "That’s for sure."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 12, "phrase": "That is for sure. Probably the weirdest that I can remember."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 14, "phrase": "Yeah. Yeah, and he was born on May the fourth."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 16, "phrase": "That’s hilarious, too."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 18, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 20, "phrase": "May the fourth be with him."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 22, "phrase": "Yes, exactly."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 24, "phrase": "It has to be."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 26, "phrase": "Hopefully. I sure hope so."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 28, "phrase": "Perfect."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 30, "phrase": "Yes."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 32, "phrase": "I mean that was the perfect day for you. How do you say the name? Is it placeholder?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 34, "phrase": "First of all, my partner is the one that actually mostly came up with the name."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 36, "phrase": "Congratulations to her."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 38, "phrase": "Yeah, yeah. She’s great at names. I mean it’s just X, the letter X, and then the ae is like pronounced ash. Yeah, and then eight, 12 is my contribution."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 40, "phrase": "Oh, why are eight, 12?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 42, "phrase": "Archangel 12, the precursor to the SR71. Coolest plane ever. True."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 44, "phrase": "I agree with you. I don’t know, I’m not familiar with it. I know what the SR71 is."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 46, "phrase": "Yeah, yeah, yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 48, "phrase": "Yeah, I know what that is."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 50, "phrase": "The SR71 came from a CIA program called Archangel. It’s the Archangel project."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 52, "phrase": "Oh wow, what a dope looking plane."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 54, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 56, "phrase": "Oh, okay. I got it."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 58, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 60, "phrase": "Well, as a person who’s a very much into aerial travel as you are, that’s perfect."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 62, "phrase": "It’s pretty great."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 64, "phrase": "Yeah. Pretty great. Does it feel strange to have a child while this craziness is going? Does it feel like you’ve had children before? Is this any weirder?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 66, "phrase": "Actually, I think it’s better being older and having a kid. I appreciate it more. Yeah, babies are awesome."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 68, "phrase": "They are pretty awesome."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 70, "phrase": "They’re awesome. Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 72, "phrase": "When I didn’t have any of my own, I would see other people’s kids and I didn’t not like them, but I wasn’t drawn to them. But now when I see little people’s kids, I’m like, Oh, I think of them as like these little love packages."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 74, "phrase": "Yeah, little love bugs."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 76, "phrase": "Yeah. It’s just you think of them differently when you see them come out and then grow and then eventually start talking to you, like your whole idea what a baby is, is very different."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 78, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 80, "phrase": "Now, as you get older and get to appreciate it as a mature, fully formed adult, it must be really pretty wonderful."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 82, "phrase": "Yeah. Great. Wonderful. It’s great. But babies are awesome. Yeah, it’s great. Yeah. Also, I’ve spent a lot of time on AI and neural nets and so you can sort of see the brain develop, which is … An AI neural net is trying to simulate what a brain does, basically. You can sort of see it learning very quickly. You know, it’s just wow."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 84, "phrase": "You’re talking about the neural net, you’re not talking about an actual baby."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 86, "phrase": "I’m talking about an actual baby."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 88, "phrase": "But both of them."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 90, "phrase": "Yes, but the word neural net comes from the brain. It’s like a net of neurons. Humans are the original gangster of the neural net."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 92, "phrase": "That’s a great way to put it."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 94, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 96, "phrase": "When you’re programming artificial intelligence where you’re working with artificial intelligence art, are they specifically trying to mimic the developmental process of a human brain?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 98, "phrase": "In a lot of ways. There’s some ways that are different. An analogy that’s often used is like we don’t make a submarine swim like a fish, but we take the principles of hydrodynamics and apply them to the submarine."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 100, "phrase": "I’ve always wondered as a lay person, do you try to achieve the same results as the human brain but through different methods? Or do you try to copy the way a human brain achieves results?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 102, "phrase": "I mean, the essential elements of an AI neural net are really very similar to a human brain neural net. Yeah. It’s having the multiple layers of neurons and you know, back propagation. All these things are what your brain does. You have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition and then it’ll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place. It’s interesting. Very interesting."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 104, "phrase": "Yeah, I would imagine. The thought of programming something that is eventually going to be smarter than us that one day it’s going to be like, why did you do it that way? When artificial intelligence becomes sentient, they’re like, Oh, you tried to mimic yourself. This is so much better process. Cut out all this nonsense."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 106, "phrase": "Like I said, there are elements that are the same but just like an aircraft does not fly like a bird."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 108, "phrase": "Right."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 110, "phrase": "It doesn’t flap its wings, but the wings, the way the wings work and generate lift is the same as a bird."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 112, "phrase": "Now you’re in the middle of this strange time where you’re selling your houses. You say you don’t want any material possessions and I’ve been seeing all that and I’ve been really excited to talk to you about this. Because it’s an interesting thing to come from a guy like yourself. Like why are you doing that?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 114, "phrase": "I’m slightly sad about it, actually."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 116, "phrase": "If you’re sad about it, why are you doing it?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 118, "phrase": "I think possessions kind of weigh you down and they’re kind of an attack vector. They’ll say, “Hey, billionaire, you’ve got all this stuff.” Well, now I don’t have stuff now what are you going to do?"}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 120, "phrase": "Attack vector meaning like people targeted."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 122, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 124, "phrase": "Interesting, yeah. But you’re obviously going to, so you’re going to rent a place?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 126, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 128, "phrase": "Okay, and get rid of everything except clothes?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 130, "phrase": "No, I said like almost everything, so it’s like …"}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 132, "phrase": "Keep a couple of Teslas."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 134, "phrase": "Kind of have to, to test product and stuff. You know, there’s things that have sentimental value for sure are keeping those."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 136, "phrase": "Do you feel like … [crosstalk 00:06:39]"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 138, "phrase": "I mean, what’s the worst that could happen? I mean, you’re fine."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 140, "phrase": "Yeah, you can always buy more stuff if you don’t like it."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 142, "phrase": "I suppose so."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 144, "phrase": "Yeah, I mean from the money that you sell all your stuff, you can buy new stuff. Do you feel like people define you by the fact that you’re wealthy and that they define you in a pejorative way?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 146, "phrase": "For sure. I mean not everyone, but for sure in recent years billionaire has become pejorative like that’s a bad thing. Which I think doesn’t make a lot of sense in most cases. If you basically organized a company … How does this wealth arise? If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before and you have some ownership in that company then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 148, "phrase": "There’s a conflation of consumption and capital allocation. Take Warren Buffet, for example, and to be totally frank I’m not his biggest fan, but you know, he does like have full allocation and he reads a lot of annual reports of companies and all the accounting and it’s pretty boring really. He’s trying to figure out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital? I mean it’s kind of a boring job if you ask me."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 150, "phrase": "It’s still a thing that’s important to figure out. Like, which is a company deserving of more or less capital. Should that company grow or expand? Is it making products and services that are better than others or worse? If a company is making compelling products and services, it should get more capital and if it’s not, it should get less or go out of business."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 152, "phrase": "Well, there’s a big difference, too, between someone who’s making an incredible amount of money designing and engineering fantastic products versus someone who’s making an incredible amount of money by investing in companies or moving money around in the stock market or doing things along those lines. It’s a different thing and to put them all in the same category seems, it’s very simple. As you pointed out, it’s an attack vector."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 154, "phrase": "Yeah, for sure. I think it’s really, I do think there, in the United States especially, there’s an over allocation of talent in finance and law. Basically, too many smart people go into finance and law. This is both a compliment and a criticism. We should have, I think, fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 156, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 158, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 160, "phrase": "Well that would certainly be better for all involved if they made better stuff."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 162, "phrase": "Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Manufacturing used to be highly valued in the United States and these days it’s not. It’s often looked down upon, which I think is wrong."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 164, "phrase": "Yeah. Well, I think that people are kind of learning that particularly because of this whole pandemic and this relationship that we have with China, that there’s a lot of value in making things and to making things here."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 166, "phrase": "Yes. Somebody’s got to do the real work."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 168, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 170, "phrase": "You know? Making a car, it’s an honest days living, that’s for sure. Making anything, really, or providing a valuable service like providing good entertainment, good information, these are all valuable things to do. Yeah, there should be more of it."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 172, "phrase": "Did you have a moment where, is this something that this idea of getting rid of your material possessions is it something that built up over time or did you have a moment of realization where you realized that …"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 174, "phrase": "Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it for a while. You know, part of it is like I have a bunch of houses, but I don’t spend a lot of time in most of them. That doesn’t seem like a good use of assets. Somebody could probably be enjoying those houses and get better use of them me."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 176, "phrase": "Don’t you have Gene Wilder’s house?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 178, "phrase": "I do."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 180, "phrase": "That’s amazing."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 182, "phrase": "It’s awesome."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 184, "phrase": "Wow."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 186, "phrase": "Yes. It’s exactly what you’d expect."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 188, "phrase": "Did you request that the buyer not fuck it up?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 190, "phrase": "Yeah, that’s a requirement."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 192, "phrase": "Oh, a requirement? That’s a good requirement."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 194, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 196, "phrase": "In that case in that house."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 198, "phrase": "Yeah, it’ll probably sell for less, but still I don’t care."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 200, "phrase": "Oh, he’s a legend. He’d want his soul, he’d want his essence in the building."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 202, "phrase": "And it’s there."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 204, "phrase": "Is it?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 206, "phrase": "It’s a real quirky house, yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 208, "phrase": "What makes you say that? What do you get out of it?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 210, "phrase": "I mean, all the cabinets are like handmade and they’re like odd shapes and there’s like doors to nowhere and strange corridors and tunnels and odd paintings on the wall. Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 212, "phrase": "Did you ever live in it?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 214, "phrase": "It’s very quirky. I did live in it briefly, yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 216, "phrase": "But why do you buy houses? If you own all these houses, do you just get bored and go I think I’d like to have that?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 218, "phrase": "Well, I had one house and the Gene Wilder house is right across the road from me from my main house. It was going to get sold and then torn down and turned into, you know, be a big construction zone for three years. I was like, whoa, I think I’ll buy it and preserve the spirit of Gene Wilder and not have a giant construction zone. Then I started having some privacy issues where people would just come to my house and start climbing over the walls and stuff. I’m like, man …"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 220, "phrase": "Then I sort of bought some of the houses around my house and then I thought at one point, well you know, it’d be cool to build a house. I acquired some properties at the top of Somera Road, which has got a great view, and I was like, okay, well there’s a bunch of sort of small older houses, they’re going to get torn down, anyway. I was like, well, if I collect these little houses then I can build something, I don’t know, artistic like a dream house type of thing."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 222, "phrase": "What’s a dream house for Elon Musk? Like some Tony stark type shit?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 224, "phrase": "Yeah, definitely. Yeah. You got to have the dome that opens up with the stealth helicopter and that kind of thing, you know?"}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 226, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 228, "phrase": "For sure."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 230, "phrase": "Fuck yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 232, "phrase": "Definitely. But then I was like, man, does it really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and I’d be real, you know, ghetto like OCD on the little details and the design, or should I be allocating that time to getting us to Mars? I should probably do the latter. Like what’s more important? Mars or a house? I’m like Mars. Okay."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 234, "phrase": "Is that really how you think? Like, I’d be better off planning on a trip to Mars or getting people to Mars?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 236, "phrase": "Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, you can only do so many things."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 238, "phrase": "Right."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 240, "phrase": "Right, so how are you going to [crosstalk 00:14:27]"}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 242, "phrase": "Well, I don’t know how you do what you do anyway. I don’t understand how you can run The Boring Company, Tesla, SpaceX, all these different things you’re doing constantly. I just, I don’t understand. I mean, you explained last time you were here how you sort of allocate your time and how hectic it is and insane. I still don’t, the productivity is baffling. It just doesn’t make sense how you can get so much done."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 244, "phrase": "Well, I think I do have high productivity, but even with that there’s still some opportunity to [inaudible 00:14:57] time and allocating time to building a house, even if it was a really great house, it still is not a good use of time relative to developing the rockets necessary to get us to Mars and helping solve sustainable energy. SpaceX and Tesla are by far, you know, the most amount of brain cycles. The Boring Company does not take, you know, it’s like less than 1% of brain cycles. Then this neural link, which is, I don’t know, maybe it’s like 5% and then …"}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 246, "phrase": "5%? That’s a good chunk."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 248, "phrase": "It’s a good chunk. Yeah, yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 250, "phrase": "We were talking about that last time and you were trying to figure out when it was actually going to go live, when it’s actually going to be available. Are you testing on people right now?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 252, "phrase": "No, we’re not testing on people yet, but I think it won’t be too long. I think we may be able to implant a neural link in less than a year in a person I think."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 254, "phrase": "When you do this, is there any tests that you have to do before you do something like this to see what percentage of people’s bodies are going to reject these things? Is there a potential for rejection?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 256, "phrase": "It’s a very low potential for rejection. I mean, you can think of it like people put in heart monitors and things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation obviously like artificial hips and knees and that kind of thing. The probability of, I mean, so it’s well known what will cause rejection and what will not. It’s definitely harder when you’ve got something that is sort of reading and writing neurons that’s generating a current pulse and reading current pulses. That’s a little harder than say a passive device, but it’s still very doable. There are people who have primitive devices in their brains right now."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 258, "phrase": "What kind of devices?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 260, "phrase": "Well, like deep brain stimulation, I think for Parkinson’s, has really changed people’s lives in a big way, which is kind of remarkable because it kind of like zaps your brain. It’s like kicking the TV type of thing. You think like man, kicking the TV shouldn’t work."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 262, "phrase": "It does sometimes."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 264, "phrase": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 266, "phrase": "The old TVs."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 268, "phrase": "It did."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 270, "phrase": "My grandpa used to slap the top."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 272, "phrase": "For sure. Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 274, "phrase": "It would work sometimes."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 276, "phrase": "Yeah, so this deep brain stimulation implanted devices in the brain have changed people’s lives for the better like fundamentally."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 278, "phrase": "Well, let’s talk about what you can talk about to what Neuralink is cause the last time you were here you really couldn’t discuss it. Then there was, I guess a press release or something that sort of outlined … [crosstalk 00:18:04]"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 280, "phrase": "Oh yeah, sure, sure."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 282, "phrase": "Yeah, that had happened quite a bit after the last time you were here. What exactly is it? How do you do, what happens if someone ultimately does get a Neuralink installed what will take place?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 284, "phrase": "Well, for version one of the device, it would be it basically implanted in your skull. It would be flush with your skull, so you basically take out a chunk of skull, put the Neuralink device in there. You’d insert the electrode threads very carefully into the brain and then you stitch it up and you wouldn’t even know that somebody has it. It can interface basically anywhere in your brain. It could be something that helps cure say eyesight, like returns your eyesight even if you’ve lost your optic nerve type of thing."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 286, "phrase": "Really?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 288, "phrase": "Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, pretty much anything that it could, in principle, fix almost anything that is wrong with the brain. It could restore limb functionality, so if you’ve got an interface into the motor cortex and then an implant that’s like a microcontroller and near muscle groups, you could then create sort of a neural shunt that restores somebody who is a quadriplegic to full functionality. Like they can walk around and be normal."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 290, "phrase": "Whoa."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 292, "phrase": "Yeah, maybe slightly better."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 294, "phrase": "Slightly better?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 296, "phrase": "Over time, yes."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 298, "phrase": "You mean with future iterations?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 300, "phrase": "Like the, you know, $6 million man. Although these days that doesn’t sound like much."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 302, "phrase": "Right, that’s pretty cheap."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 304, "phrase": "Yeah. Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 306, "phrase": "$6 billion man."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 308, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 310, "phrase": "The hole would be small, how big would the hole be that you have to drill and then replace with this piece? It’s only one hole?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 312, "phrase": "Well, yeah, the device we’re working on right now is about, it’s about an inch in diameter. Your skull is pretty thick, by the way."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 314, "phrase": "Mine is for sure."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 316, "phrase": "It might actually, literally, I mean if you’re a big guy, your skull is actually fairly thick. A skull is like seven to 14 millimeters."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 318, "phrase": "Mines probably a couple of inches."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 320, "phrase": "A half inch. Half inch thick skull ish. Yeah, yeah, that’s a fair bit of like … We’ve got quite a coconut going on there. It’s not like some eggshell."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 322, "phrase": "Oh yeah, I believe you."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 324, "phrase": "Yeah, you basically implant the device."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 326, "phrase": "It would be like a one inch square? One inch in diameter, so an inch circle?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 328, "phrase": "Yeah, think like a smartwatch or something like that."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 330, "phrase": "Oh, okay."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 332, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 334, "phrase": "Okay, so you take this one diameter like ice fishing, right?

I actually sort of sympathize with the anti-globalization people, because it’s like, man, we don’t ever want everywhere to be the same for sure. Then we need some kind of mind viral immunity. So that’s a bit concerning."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 658, "phrase": "Mind viral immunity, meaning that once something like Neuralink gets established, the real concern is something that, I mean you said it’s Bluetooth, right? Or some future version of that.

Okay. Like cult thinking or some sort of fundamentalism."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 668, "phrase": "Yeah. It’s just wrongheaded idea that goes viral in an idea sense."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 670, "phrase": "Well that is a problem too, right? If someone can manipulate that technology to make something appear logical or rational."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 672, "phrase": "Yeah. Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 674, "phrase": "Would that be an issue too, this is a very have versus have not issue.

So you could definitely just, I don’t know, take out a loan and do it and earn the money back real fast. Be super smart."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 682, "phrase": "Well in a capitalist society, it seems like you could really get so far ahead that before everybody else could afford this thing and link up and get connected as well. You’d be so far ahead, they can never catch you. Is that a concern?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 684, "phrase": "Well, it’s not a super huge concern. I mean there are huge differences in cognitive ability and resources already. You can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective that’s far smarter than an individual. I couldn’t personally build a whole rocket and the engines and launch it and everything. That’s impossible."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 686, "phrase": "But we have 8,000 people at SpaceX and you’re piecing it out to different people and using computers and machines and stuff. We can make lots of rockets launch into orbit, dock with the space station and that kind of thing. So that already exists where those corporations are vastly more capable than an individual. But we should be, I think less concerned about relative capabilities between people and more like having AI be vastly beyond us and decoupled from human will."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 688, "phrase": "Decoupled from human.

Yeah, like beyond a level that’s difficult to understand and impossible to understand probably."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 696, "phrase": "Somehow or another, so it’s almost like it’s a requirement for survival to achieve some sort of symbiotic existence with AI."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 698, "phrase": "It’s not a requirement. It’s just if you want to be along for the ride then you need to do some kind of symbiosis. So the way your brain works right now, you’ve got kind of like the animal brain, reptile brain, kind of like the lymphic system basically. You’ve got the cortex. Now the brain purist will argue with this definition, but essentially you’ve got the primitive brain and you’ve got the sort of smart brain or the brain that’s capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey can’t understand."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 700, "phrase": "Now your cortex is much, much smarter than your lymphic system. Nonetheless, they work together well. So I haven’t met anyone who wants to delete their lymphic system or their cortex. People are quite happy having both. So you can think of this as being like the computer, the AI is like a third layer, a tertiary layer. So that could be symbiotic with the cortex. It’d be much smarter than the cortex, but you essentially have three layers and you actually have that right now."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 702, "phrase": "Your phone is capable of things and your computer is capable of things that your brain is definitely not. Storing terabytes of information perfectly, doing incredible calculations that we couldn’t even come close to doing. You have that with your computer. It’s just like I said, the data rate is slow, the connection is weak."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 704, "phrase": "Why is it so disconcerting or why does it not give me comfort to think about? Like when I think about a symbiotic connection to AI, I always think of this cold, emotionless sort of thing that we will become. Is that a bad way to look at it?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 706, "phrase": "I don’t think, that’s not how it would be. Like I said you already are symbiotic with AI or computers."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 708, "phrase": "Phones, computers, laptops."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 710, "phrase": "Yeah, there’s quite a bit of AI going on, artificial neural nets. Increasingly, neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming more and more. So you are connected, if you use Google Voice or Alexa or one of those things, it’s using a neural net to decode your speech and try understand what you were saying."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 712, "phrase": "If you’re trying to do image recognition or improve the quality of photograph, the neural nets the best way to do that. So you are already sort of a cybernetic symbiote. Like I said, it’s just a question of your data rate. The communication speed between your phone and your brain is slow."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 714, "phrase": "When do you think you’re going to do it? How long will you wait? Once it starts becoming available?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 716, "phrase": "Yeah, if it works I’ll do it. Sure."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 718, "phrase": "Right away."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 720, "phrase": "I mean let’s make sure it works."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 722, "phrase": "How do we make sure it works? We try it on prisoners? What do you do? Take rapists? Cut holes in their head?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 724, "phrase": "No, like I said, if somebody has got a serious brain injury and people that have very severe brain injuries and then you can fix those brain injuries. Then you prove out that it works and [inaudible 00:53:06] expand and make more and more brain injuries, solve more and more. At a certain age we all are going to get Alzheimer’s or we’re all going to get senile. Then moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 726, "phrase": "It’s like you said, okay, well this would allow you to remember your names of your kids and have a normal, a much more normal life where you were able to function much later in life. So I think essentially almost everyone would find a need at some point if you get old enough to use Neuralink. Then it’s like, okay, so we can improve the functionality and improve the communication speed. So then you will not have to use your thumbs to communicate with the computer."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 728, "phrase": "Do you ever sit down and extrapolate? Do you ever sit down and think about all the different iterations of this and what this eventually leads to?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 730, "phrase": "Yeah, sure. I Think about it a lot. Like I said, this is not something that’s going to sneak up on you. Getting FDA approval for this stuff is not overnight. I don’t know, we probably have to be on version 10 or something before it would realistically be a human AI symbiote situation. You’ll see it coming."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 732, "phrase": "You see it coming, but when do you think it’s going to be? When you’re alone, if you have free time, I don’t know if you have free time, but if you just sit down and think about this iteration, the next onward, keep going and you drag it out with improvements along the way and leaps and bounds and technological innovations. Where do you see it? What are we going to be?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 734, "phrase": "Like when?"}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 736, "phrase": "20, 25 years from now? What are we going to be?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 738, "phrase": "Well, assuming civilization is still around, it’s looking fragile right now.

Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 744, "phrase": "What do you mean by whole brain interface?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 746, "phrase": "Almost all the neurons are connected to the sort of AI extension of yourself.

So, and now online it’s like somebody dies, there’s like an online ghost that they’re still, their online stuff is still alive."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 756, "phrase": "That’s a good way to put it. It is weird when you read someone’s tweets after they’re dead."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 758, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 760, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 762, "phrase": "Instagram and their stories and yeah, whatever Facebook and stuff."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 764, "phrase": "That’s a great way to put it. It’s like an online ghost. That’s very accurate."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 766, "phrase": "Yeah. So it would just be that more of you would be in the cloud, I guess, than in your body or more of you."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 768, "phrase": "Whoa. Now, when you say civilization’s fragile, do you mean because of this COVID-19 shit that’s going on right now?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 770, "phrase": "What’s that? I never heard of it."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 772, "phrase": "It’s this thing, it’s like some people just get a cough."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 774, "phrase": "I have no idea what you’re talking about."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 776, "phrase": "Other people it gets much worse."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 778, "phrase": "Sure. Well, yeah. I mean this certainly has taken over the mind space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 780, "phrase": "Yeah. Well, out of nowhere. That’s what’s crazy. It’s like you go back to November, nothing. Now here we are, December, January, February, March, April, May, six months. Totally different world. So from nothing to, everything’s locked down. There’s so much conflicting information and conflicting opinions about how to proceed. What has happened, you find things where there was a meat packing plant, I believe in Missouri where 300 plus people were asymptomatic, tested positive or asymptomatic."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 782, "phrase": "Then in other places it just ravages entire communities and kills people and it’s so weird. It almost appears, if you didn’t know any better, you’d be like, what? It seems like there’s a bunch of different viruses. It doesn’t seem like it’s the same thing or has a bunch of different reactions to the biological variety of people."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 784, "phrase": "Yeah, I mean I kind of saw this whole thing play out in China before it played out in the US. So it’s kind of like watching the same movie again, but in English. Yeah, I think the mortality rate is much less than what say the World Health Organization said it was. It’s much, much less. It’s like probably at least order of magnitude less."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 786, "phrase": "Well, it seems to be very deadly to very specific kinds of people and people with specific problems."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 788, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, you can look at the mortality statistics by age and whether they have comorbidities, like do they have basically existing conditions and by age. If you’re below 60 and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low. It’s not zero, but it’s extremely low."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 790, "phrase": "They didn’t think that this was the case though, when they first started to lock down the country.

It’s quite crazy."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 794, "phrase": "But in some places a panic is deserved, right? Like if you’re in the ICU in Manhattan and people are dying left and right and everyone’s on intubators. It seems like when you see all these people on ventilators and so many of them are dying and you see these nurses are dying and doctors are getting sick. In some places that fear is justified, but then in other places you’re reading these stories about hospitals that are essentially half empty. They’re having to furlough doctors and nurses because there’s no work for them."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 796, "phrase": "Most of the hospitals in the United States right now are half empty. In some cases they’re at 30% capacity."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 798, "phrase": "Is this because they’ve decided to forgo elective procedures and normal things that people would have to go to the hospital for?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 800, "phrase": "Yes.

It’s sort of elective, but if you don’t get it done in time, you’re going to die."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 806, "phrase": "Yeah, elective is a weird word."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 808, "phrase": "Elective. It’s not like, this isn’t like plastic surgery."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 810, "phrase": "Right, right."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 812, "phrase": "It’s more like my hip is, I’m in extreme pain because my hip’s blown out or my knee and I don’t want to go to the hospital. I can’t go to the hospital. People are in extreme pain, people that need a kidney, people that have quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear. So I think it’s a problem that’s not good."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 814, "phrase": "It seems."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 816, "phrase": "So I think it’s a problem that’s not good."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 818, "phrase": "It seems like the state of public perception is shifting."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 820, "phrase": "It is."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 822, "phrase": "Like people are taking some deep breaths and relaxing and because of the statistics, essentially across the board it’s being recognized that it’s not as fatal as we thought it was. Still dangerous, still worse than a flu, but not as bad as we thought or we feared it could be."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 824, "phrase": "Objectively the mortality is much lower. At least a factor of 10, maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 826, "phrase": "Do you think that the current way we’re handling this, the social distancing, the mask, the locking down, does this make sense? Is it adequate?

Washing your hands is also good."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 834, "phrase": "Well there’s a speculation why men get it more than women because men are disgusting. We don’t wash our hands as much."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 836, "phrase": "Men are disgusting it’s true. It’s bad."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 838, "phrase": "It’s true, I admit it, we are all men in this room.

Just go to the restroom you can see it’s horrible."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 842, "phrase": "Yes we’re gross. My nine year old daughter yells at me, she goes, “Did you wash your hands?” She makes me go back and wash my hands. She’s right. Nine years old. If I had a nine year old boy do you think he would care? He wouldn’t give a fuck if I washed my hands."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 844, "phrase": "True.

I think this has shaken up the system. the system is somewhat moribund with lot of layers of bureaucracy and I think that we’ve cut through some of that bureaucracy. And at some point there probably will be a pandemic with a high mortality rate. Debate about like what’s high. but I mean something that’s killing a lot of 20 year olds, let’s say. Like if you had Ebola type of mortality."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 850, "phrase": "Spanish flu, something that attacks the immune systems of healthy people."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 852, "phrase": "Yeah. Like killing large numbers of young healthy people, to find that as like a high mortality than that. This is at least practice for something like that. And I think there’s this, given it’s just a matter, that there will be eventually some such pandemic."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 854, "phrase": "Do you think that in a sense, the one good thing that we might get out of this is the realization that this is a potential reality? That we got lucky in the sense?, I mean people that didn’t get lucky and died, of course I’m not disrespecting their death and their loss, but I’m saying overall as a culture, as a community, as a human race, as a community, this is not as bad as it could have been. This is a good dry run for us to appreciate that we need far more resources dedicated towards understanding these diseases, what to do in the case of pandemic, and much more money that goes to funding treatments and some preventative measures."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 856, "phrase": "Yeah, absolutely. And I think there’s a good chance, it’s highly likely, I think, coming out of this that we will develop vaccines that we didn’t have before for coronaviruses, other viruses, and possibly cures for these. And our understanding of viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it’s received. So there’s definitely a lot of silver linings here."}, {"author": "Joe Rogan", "serial_number": 858, "phrase": "Potentially, if we act correctly."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 860, "phrase": "Yeah.

How amazing is it that all these people do have the ability to express themselves?” I mean, you don’t necessarily want to be there when the shit hits you.

That’s madness."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 1608, "phrase": "Well with a Roadster, we’re going to do some things that are kind of unfair.

We’re building new technologies and improving the fundamental product. So we’re not spending, doing hundreds of practice things or anything like that. We don’t have time for that. But, just hours before the demo, both Franz, head of design and I were in the studio throwing steel balls at the window, and it’s bouncing right off. And like, “Okay, this seems pretty good. It seems like we got it.” Okay?

So we’ll start off with the size, the dimensions. And the inspiration. So the functionality I’m going to describe is within a space that is less than the most popular pickup truck in the United States, the F150. So we didn’t cheat in either width, height, or length, and we’re able to achieve much greater capability in the same dimensions, same weight. Yeah. Part of this is the fundamental design change, we moved the mass to the outside. We created an exoskeleton."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 2, "phrase": "So normally the way that a truck is designed, you have a body on frame, you have a bed on frame and the body and the bed don’t do anything useful. They’re carried like cargo, like a sack of potatoes. It was the way that aircraft used to be designed, when they had biplanes, basically. The key to creating an effective monoplane was a stressed skin design. You move the stress to the outside skin. Allows you to do things that you can’t do with a body on frame. So we’re able to make the skin out of thick, ultra hard stainless steel. It’s really hard. We’re going to show you just how hard."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 4, "phrase": "So Franz has a sledgehammer. Now don’t hold back.

For some weird reason it broke now. I don’t know why. Fix it in post."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 80, "phrase": "In addition, the car has an adaptive air suspension. It’s literally built… Yeah, with adaptive air suspension. So this will come standard on all the cars. I think this is actually a very important design element because if you have a… If every truck has the ability to adjust the ride height so you can go very low or very high, so you can be efficient on the highway and you can also go off-roading. It’s going to have the highest clearance of any production truck. So it would have about a 16 inch clearance. And you can adjust this on the fly. So it’s adaptive damping and adaptive ride height. These are actually extremely important for a truck. Because trucks when you only drive them, they’re either too cushy or they’re too hard. You need it to be able to adjust dynamically depending upon what the load is. If you’ve got a lot of people on board, if you’ve got a full bed in the back, it’s got to adjust accordingly."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 82, "phrase": "So yeah, let’s talk about the… We call it the Volt. Cybertruck Volt. Let’s look… Let’s demo this active. Yeah. The rear is a hundred cubic feet, six and a half foot length, bed length, up to 3,500 pounds of payload. Yeah. And it can tow… But what about a real world test? Let’s actually have a tug of war here with an F150. So you can see which one can pull which. Let’s do the tug of war video. I mean, yeah. It was uphill."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 84, "phrase": "So let’s see.

Okay, we’re going to give the Porsche a little bit of a headstart. Yeah. This is a current edition Porsche. And this is the actual truck. This is not CGI. In terms of off road performance, it’s going to have the best angular approach angle, best clearance heights, best departure angle. For people that are really going off road, this is going to be great. You could basically do the Baja Rally in this thing."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 94, "phrase": "We have three ranges. So yeah. So obviously it’ll have access to all the superchargers, be capable of more than 250 kilowatts, we’ll reveal the actual number later, and it has onboard outlets for 110 and 220 volts. So you don’t need a generator. The truck literally is your generator. And, as a little plus, because it’s got an air suspension, we can tap off the air suspension so you have a pneumatic source. So you have an… Yeah. Onboard air compressor. Of course it will come with autopilot standard. Yep."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 96, "phrase": "So there’ll be three versions. But it’s going to… [crosstalk 00:13:48] That’s the price without any incentives. That’s just like the price without any incentives. But the actual economics are even better than that because the cost of electricity is much less than the cost of gasoline. So when you look at the actual cost of ownership here, it’s… You’re paying much less for electricity than you are for the gasoline. You’re paying much less for maintenance. There’s no oil changes, no smog checks, no nothing, none of that stuff. So your maintenance is low, your cost of operations are low. And so it’s actually comparable to a truck, a gasoline truck, that’s 10 to $15,000 less. Yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 98, "phrase": "All right. Yeah.

[crosstalk 00:16:30]"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 116, "phrase": "So you can see the truck. This is what I mean by the adaptive air suspension. Nice work, by the way. So the adaptive air suspension, you can drop real low and go high on the other side with [inaudible 00:17:19] load mode. So you’ve got load mode, you’ve got a built-in ramp. You can take a ATV or dirt bike, whatever you want, and load it on the back."}, {"author": "Speaker 15", "serial_number": 118, "phrase": "And it’s charging."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 120, "phrase": "Yes.

Elon."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 4, "phrase": "Sure. So to recap, Q2, 2021 was the record quarter on many levels. We achieved record production [inaudible 00:01:35] , and surpassed over a billion dollars and gap income for the first time in Tesla history. I’d really like to congratulate everyone at Tesla for an amazing job. This is really an incredible milestone. It also seems that public sentiment towards Ev’s is at an inflection point. And this point, I think almost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward. Regarding supply chain, while we’re making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious. For the rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest parts in our supply chain, which is there’s a wide range of chips that are at various times the slowest parts of the supply chain. I mean, it’s worth noting that if we had everything else, if we had vast numbers of vehicles in sales, we were not able to make them, if everything except the chips, we would be able to make them. The chips supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output. It’s difficult for us to say how long this will last because we don’t have, this is because out of our control, essentially. It does seem like it’s getting better, but it’s hard to predict. So in fact, even achieving the output that we did achieve was only due to an immense effort from people within Tesla. We were able to substitute alternative chips and then write the firmware in a matter of weeks. It’s not just a matter of swapping out a chip. You also have to rewrite the software. So it was an incredibly intense effort of finding new chips, writing new firmware, integrating with the vehicle and testing in order to maintain production. And I also like to thank our suppliers who worked with us and there’ve been many calls, midnight, 1:00 AM just with suppliers, in resolving a lot of the shortages. So thanks very much to our suppliers."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 6, "phrase": "Let’s see in terms of epic FST subscription, we were able to launch a full self driving subscription last month and we expect it to build slowly and then, but then gather a lot of [inaudible 00:04:09] over time. Obviously we need to have the full self-driving [inaudible 00:04:14] widely available for it really to take off at a high rate. And we’re making a lot of progress there. So yeah, I think FSC subscription will be a significant factor probably next year."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 8, "phrase": "We’ve got two Giga, Texas, and Giga, Berlin, we’re actually doing this earnings call from Giga, Texas. So we’re in the factory right now doing this earnings call. And the team has made incredible progress here. You can see the pictures online and see that there’s basically nothing a year ago and this mostly complete large factory a year later. So really, really great work by the Giga, Texas team. And then also great work in Berlin- Brandenburg with the team there. So we expect to be producing the sort of new design of the Model Y in both factories in limited production later this year. It’s always like, it’s hard to sort of explain to people who have not been through the agony of a manufacturing ramp. Like, why can’t you just turn it on and make 5,000 a week. This is, it is so hard to do manufacturing. It is so hard to do production. First approximation, there are thousand unique parts and processes that have to work. And the greater growth of production goes as fast as the least lucky and dumbest of those 10,000 things."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 10, "phrase": "And a bunch of them are not even in our control. So it’s insanely difficult. I’m fond of saying that prototypes are easy and production is hard. And I do believe that the really remarkable thing that Tesla’s done, it’s not to make an electric car or to be a car startup because there’ve been hundreds of car startups in the United States and outside United States. So the thing that’s remarkable is that Tesla didn’t go bankrupt in reaching volume production. That’s the amazing part because everyone else did because they all thought the prototype or the idea was the hard part, and it is not. It is trivial by comparison with actual production. So it’s always worth noting that of all the American car companies, there are only two that have not gone bankrupt, and that is Ford and Tesla. So, the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory. And we must be careful that we cannot do that. They often, if you look at the look at history, so often at the Caesar’s feet are set on the day of victory. We will endeavor not to make that the case at Tesla."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 12, "phrase": "So let’s see. The Model Y is in Texas and made Texas, and Berlin will look very much like the Model Y’s we currently make, but that there are substantial improvements in the difficulty of manufacturing. So for example, the Model Y made here and in Berlin will have a cast front body and a cast rear body. Whereas the one in California has cast rear body, but not a cast front body. We’re also aiming to do a structural pack with 4680 cells, which is a mass reduction and a cost reduction. But we’re not counting on that as the only way to make things work. We have some backup plans with a non-structural pack and 2170, essentially. So, but at scale production, we obviously want to be using 4680’s and structural pack. From a physics standpoint, this is the best architecture. And from an economic standpoint, it is the lowest cost way to go. So the lightest, lowest cost, but there’s a lot of new technology there. So it’s difficult predict with precision. When does it work and when do you reach the scale production. Andrew’s going to talk a bit more about the 4680 productions."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 14, "phrase": "Yeah. So we are making great progress in 4680 cells, but there is a tremendous amount of innovation that we’re packing into that 4680 cell. And so it’s not simply a sort of minor improvements on state of the art. There are… And we went through this on the factory sell date, really dozens of, half a dozen major improvements and dozens of small improvements. So I think it will be great, but it’s [inaudible 00:09:43] to say when the last of the technical challenges will be solved."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 16, "phrase": "So in conclusion, our team continues to make huge efforts to make our factories run at full speed, which is very difficult. We have had some factory shutdowns due to a power shortages, and we hope those will be relieved in the coming weeks and months. And we’re making great progress on self driving. So far this is not easy to see because of, at the foundational software level. And so it ends up being sort of a two steps forward, one step back situation, and, but over time, if you do two steps forward, one step back and keep going, you do move forward. So I’m highly confident that the cars will be capable of full self-driving if they full self-driving computer and the cameras, I’m confident that they will be able to drive themselves with the safety levels substantially greater than that of the average post. But again, thanks to all of our employees who are making this a breakthrough year for Tesla and an incredible quarter. Thanks, guys."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 18, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And we have some follow-up remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 20, "phrase": "Yeah. Thanks Martin. And thanks, Elon. Just to reiterate, Q2 was a great quarter for the Tesla team with strong improvements across the business. In particular, auto gross profit and margin, excluding credits increased substantially. This was primarily driven by better cost optimization across our factories, good execution against our cost reduction plans, as well as increases in production and delivery volumes. There was some benefit from pricing action, mostly in North America. However, it was small in the context of the other contributors. Note that the Model S and X program, was at a slight loss for the quarter due to the relatively low volume. In supply chain challenges, including expedites continued to provide costs headwinds. Additionally, it’s encouraging to see the progress made on profitability within our energy and services and other businesses. While there’s some benefit to looking at our progress quarter over quarter, I find it more helpful to look at progress over a slightly long-term horizon."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 22, "phrase": "Over the last two years, our vehicle delivery volumes have more than doubled. This volume increase was made possible by a steady decrease in ASP’s of more than 10%, driven by a roadmap to increase affordability and shifting mix towards our more affordable vehicles. Yet over that same period of time, our auto gross margin excluding credit has increased nearly 25 percentage points to our highest yet since the introduction of Model 3. This is only possible because our average cost per vehicle has reduced by more than the reduction in average price. This is a remarkable achievement in the context of the volume growth and ASP reduction as mentioned, and a testament to the hard work by the Tesla team."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 24, "phrase": "Additionally, OPEX as a percentage of revenue has declined. And in particular SGNA representing the work we’ve done to become more efficient as we scale the company while still making the required R&D investments to support our future. As a result, our gap operating margins have risen from negative to double digit in line with what we have guided. By managing our overhead costs and driving higher volumes, our P&L is benefiting from the marginal profitability of each incremental unit. Or said differently, we are recognizing the benefits of scale and improved fixed costs absorption. With strong operating cash flows and cash balance, we were putting that cash to use. CapEx continues to tick up primarily driven by capacity investments in Austin, Berlin, and Shanghai. Additionally, each quarter we are using our cash to retire legacy debt, which was taken on at a time when interest rates and company risk were much higher than in today’s environment. As I’ve mentioned before, our 2021 volumes will skew towards the second half of the year, as we push for continued sequential increases in volume. Despite the great work so far, managing the instability of the supply chain, these challenges remain and are unfortunately increasing in pain with a higher volume."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 26, "phrase": "As we work through the uncertainty, we want to ensure we do our best to manage customer wait times as well as the impact these interruptions have on our employees and costs. And as Elon mentioned, volume growth will be determined by part availability as we have the factory capacity ready and are in a strong demand position. I’m excited to see the progress made by the Tesla team as we continue building the business and strengthening our financials. Thank you very much."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 28, "phrase": "Great. Thank you very much, Zach. And now let’s go through the retail investor questions on say.com. The first question from Robert M. is, Tesla’s website still says cyber truck production is expected to begin in late 2021. Can Tesla share more details on the current status of the cyber truck and confirm if production is still-"}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 30, "phrase": "Okay. Martin, do you want to-"}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 32, "phrase": "Sorry. We cut out there for a second."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 34, "phrase": "Sorry, we cut out there for a second. Yeah. The Cybertruck is currently in its alpha stages. We finished basic engineering architecture of the vehicle. With the Cybertruck we’re redefining how the vehicle is being made. As Elon said, it carries much of the structural pack and large casting designs of the model Y being built in Berlin and Austin. Obviously those take priority over the Cybertruck, but we are moving into the beta phases of Cybertruck later this year. And we’ll be looking to ramp that in production in [inaudible 00:15:34] Texas after model Y is up and going."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 36, "phrase": "Yeah. I just want to reemphasize the extraordinary difficulty of ramping production of large manufactured items. At risk of being repetitive, it’s actually easy to make prototypes or sort of handle small volume production, but anything produced at high volume, which is really what’s relevant here, it’s going to move as fast as the slowest of the, say rough order of magnitude, 10,000 unique parts and processes. And so you can have 9,999, where just one is missing. We were missing, for example, a big struggle this quarter was the module that controls the airbags and the seatbelts. And obviously you cannot strip a car without those. And that limited our production severely worldwide, in Shanghai and in Fremont. So it wouldn’t have mattered if we had 17 different car models, because they all need the airbag module. It’s just irrelevant."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 38, "phrase": "So in order for Cybertruck and Semi to scale to volume that’s meaningful for customer deliveries, we’ve got to solve the chip shortage, or working with our suppliers. People sometimes say, why don’t you just build a chip vat? Okay. Well, okay. That would take us, even moving like lightening, 12 to 18 months. So it’s not like you can just whip up a chip vat. It’s just like, yeah, just make a quick chip vat."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 40, "phrase": "So some of these things are … yeah. Anyway, it is quite a trial dealing with all of the constraints of scaling a large manufactured object. I think it may be the case that Tesla is scaling. I think we might be the fastest in history ever for scaling a large manufactured object. Maybe the Model T would have been comparable back in the day of the Ford Model T. Probably internet knows the answer, but I think we may be scaling large manufactured objects at the fastest rate in history, or I’d like to know who did it faster so we can learn from them."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 42, "phrase": "So it’s worth just noting that, in the grand scheme of things, it’s not bad. So, yeah. So the Cybertruck and Semi actually both are heavy users of sub capacity, so we’ve got to make sure we have the sub capacity for those two vehicles or it’s kind of pointless. We can make a small number of vehicles, but the effective cost, if you make a small number of vehicles, is insane. They would literally cost a million dollars piece or more. There’s a reason why you do things at volume production, which is to get the economies of scale that get the cost down."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 44, "phrase": "So we are looking at a pretty massive increase in cell availability next year, but it’s not like in January one, it comes through … it ramps up through the course of next year. But even without Tesla … (silence)."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 46, "phrase": "Hello? Even without Tesla’s cell production, our suppliers will be able to deliver about twice as much cell output in next year as this year. [inaudible 00:19:51], do you want to talk more about that?"}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 48, "phrase": "Yeah. Given concerns over cell’s bottlenecking growth, our target is to grow cell supply ahead of the 50% year on year growth targets of the vehicle business and also enable increased energy storage deployments. So yeah, our cells suppliers are tracking to double their production in 2022."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 50, "phrase": "Yeah. It’s worth noting. If you have a target of a certain number, that doesn’t mean it happens as sure as night follows day. It’s a target. So if there is some calamity in the world that interrupts the supply chain, then it will be less. But the contracts that we have with cell suppliers, roughly a doubling of cell supply to Tesla in 2022. And we have to joggle these exponential … it’s whole bunch of exponential graphs, sort of overlayed on top of each other. And small changes in where you are on the X axis of time can quite substantially change the area under the code. So what we’re thinking of doing is, depending on if … It’s basically overshooting on cell supply for vehicles, and then, as we have, say excess cell supply in one month or another, then routing that cell’s outputs to the Megapack and Powerwall. [inaudible 00:21:30] if we’re prioritizing vehicle production, if there’s a shortage of cell output for some reason, then we will throttle down Megapack and Powerwall production. But something’s got to give basically."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 52, "phrase": "Or if there’s a disruption in the vehicle production, then you have an outlet for the cell capacity."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 54, "phrase": "Yes, exactly. There’s a tremendous amount of inertia in the supply chain. So if we say to a supplier, we want you to double cell output. Well, even doing that in a year is very difficult. And then that system has a tremendous amount of momentum. It is like a flotilla of supertankers. It’s insane."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 56, "phrase": "Speaking of which, from a raw materials perspective, we also have long-term contracts to secure our supply chain to also enable this growth. So we’re not just looking at the suppliers, but upstream from there. Which is more flotillas."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 58, "phrase": "Yeah. As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest parts of the entire supply chain, which goes all the way back to raw materials, lithium and nickel and that kind of thing. And there’s sometimes misperception that Tesla uses a lot of cobalt, but we actually don’t. Apple uses, I think almost 100% cobalt in their batteries and cell phones and laptops, but Tesla uses no cobalt in the iron phosphate packs and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 60, "phrase": "So on a weighted average basis, we might use 2% cobalt compared to Apple’s 100% cobalt. Anyway. So it’s really just not a factor. We expect to basically have zero cobalt in the future. I think probably there is a long-term shift, more in the direction of iron-based lithium-ion cells over nickel. As the energy density of sort of iron or iron phosphate, but might as well just call it iron, the phosphate is taken for granted. But iron-based cells, lithium-ion cells, and nickel-based lithium-ion cells, I think probably we’ll see a shift, my guess is probably to two-thirds iron, one-third nickel or something on that order."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 62, "phrase": "And this is actually good because there’s plenty of iron in the world, there’s an insane amount of iron, but nickel is … there’s much less nickel. And there’s way less cobalt. So it is good for relieving the long-term scaling to move to iron-based cells mostly. And I think long-term, possibly all … There’s a good chance that all stationary storage that is Powerwall and Megapack moves to iron. It seems most likely the case since you do not need to transport it. And there’s less of volume capacity constraint for stationary storage. So then nickel would be for, really for long range road transport, ships and aircraft and that kind of thing."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 64, "phrase": "Thank you. Let’s go to the second question from retail, which is, Elon has said that Tesla will be opening up the supercharger network to other EVs later this year. Can you share some more details on how this will be structured? Will this be select brands, or will they contribute to the growth of this network?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 66, "phrase": "Yes, we’re currently thinking it’s a real simple thing where you just download the Tesla app and you go to a supercharger and you just indicate which stall you’re in. So you plug in your power, even if it’s not Tesla, and then you just access the app and say, turn on the stall that I’m in for how much electricity. And this should basically work with almost any manufacturer’s cars. There will be a time constraint. So if the charge rate is super slow, then somebody will be charged more. Because the biggest constraint at the superchargers is time. How occupied is the stall?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 68, "phrase": "And we’ll also be smarter with how we charge for electricity at the superchargers. So rush hour charging will be more expensive than off-hours charging, because there are times when the superchargers are empty and times when they’re jam packed. And so it makes sense to have some time-based discrimination on them."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 70, "phrase": "Yeah. We’ve been doing that, and it’s been working and people respond. It helps with utilization."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 72, "phrase": "Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, I think we’re … In Europe and China and most parts of the world, it’s the same connector for everyone. So this is a fairly easy thing to do, developed our own connector, which in my opinion is actually the best connector. It’s small and light and looks good as a standard. So we developed our own connector, which in my opinion, is actually the best connector because it’s small and light and looks good."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 74, "phrase": "So an adapter is needed to work for EVs in North America, but people can buy this adapter and we anticipate having it available at the superchargers as well. If people don’t sort of steal them or something."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 76, "phrase": "We have a good solution for that one."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 78, "phrase": "Okay. So that’s a constraint on the North American thing. That’s basically a vestige of history. But I think we do want to emphasize that our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy. It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors, which is sometimes used by some companies."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 80, "phrase": "I think it’s also important to comment that increasing the utilization of the network actually reduces our costs, which allows us to lower charging prices for all customers, makes the network more profitable, allows us to grow the network faster. That’s a good thing there. And no matter what, we’re going to continue to aggressively expand the network capacity, increasing charging speeds, improving the trip planning tools to protect against site congestion, using dynamic pricing, as Elon mentioned. And just continue to focus on minimum wait time for all customers."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 82, "phrase": "Yeah. Obviously in order for superchargers to be useful to other car companies, as far as we need to grow the network faster than we’re growing vehicle output, which is not easy. We’re growing vehicle output at a hell of a rate. So superchargers needs to grow faster than vehicle output. So this is a lot of work for the supercharger team, but it is only useful, in the grand scheme of things, it’s only useful to the public if we’re able to grow faster than Tesla’s vehicle output. That is our goal."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 84, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And the third question is, Elon said 4680 cells aren’t reliable enough for vehicles.

Not to get too much into the weeds of things, but right now we have a challenge with basically what’s called calendaring, or basically squashing the cathode with material to a particular height.

But very hard pizza dough and it’s damaging the calendar rolls."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 90, "phrase": "This is not something that happened when the calendar rolls were smaller, but it is happening when the calendar rolls are bigger.

We’re actually accruing over one million equivalent miles on our cells that we produce every month in our testing activities. The focus on that is very clear. We want high quality cells for all of our customers. We’re just focused on the unlucky limiting steps in the facility, and with the engineer’s focused on those few steps remaining, we’re going to breakthrough as fast as possible."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 98, "phrase": "Meantime, we have a massive amount of equipment on order and arriving for the high volume self production in Austin and Berlin. Obviously, given what we’ve learned with the pilot plant, which is in Fremont, which is really quite a big plant by most standards, we will have to modify a bunch of that equipment.

I wouldn’t do it annually, but I’ll do it once. I think, also, this is, I would say, the last time I’ll do earnings calls. I will no longer be default doing earnings calls.

For Shanghai, it was incredible that we obtained both those factories in 11 months, but it took longer building the factory. It took longer than that to actually reach volume production, high volume production. It took about a year. When you put a factory in a new geography, in order for that factory to be efficient, you have to localize the supply chain. There’s no such thing as cut and paste. It does not exist. It would obviously be insane to do vehicle production in Europe, but send vast numbers of parts from North America. That would make producing in Europe, for example, just crazy."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 128, "phrase": "You’ve got to localize the supply chain to have efficiency, and then you’re moving as fast as your least lucky, least good supplier.

Now let’s go back to Analyst Q&A please."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 150, "phrase": "Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the pound key. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from Colin Rush with Oppenheimer. Your line is open."}, {"author": "Colin", "serial_number": 152, "phrase": "Thanks so much, guys. Can you speak to the attach rates for FSD so far, and where you’re targeting in terms of the subscription levels?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 154, "phrase": "It’s not worth commenting on right now. It’s not meaningful. We really need full self-driving, at least the beta, to be widely available so that anyone who wants it can get it. Otherwise, it would be pointless to read anything into where things are right now."}, {"author": "Colin", "serial_number": 156, "phrase": "Okay. Then just to follow up there, is about the cadence of the regulatory environment keeping up with the technology. Are you seeing meaningful evolution in terms of the regulators really understanding the technology and beginning to set some standards here sometime in the near term?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 158, "phrase": "At least in the US, we don’t see regulation as the fundamental limiter. We’ve also got to make it work, and then demonstrate that the reliability is significantly in excess of the average human driver for to be allowed, for people to be able to use it without paying attention to the road."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 160, "phrase": "I think we’re going to have a massive fleet. It will be, I think, straight forward to make the arguments on statistical grounds, just based on the number of interventions, especially in events that would result in a crash. At scale, we think we’ll have millions of miles of travel to be able to show that the safety of the car with auto pilot on is a hundred percent or 200% or more safer than the average human driver."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 162, "phrase": "At that point, I think it would be unconscionable not to allow auto pilot, because the car just becomes way less safe. It would be like-"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 164, "phrase": "Because the car becomes way less safe. Shake the elevator analogy. Back in the day, you used to have elevator operators with a big sort of switch to operate the elevator and move between floors. But, they get tired or maybe drunk or something or distracted. And every now and again, somebody would be kind of sheared in half between floors. That’s kind of the situation we have with cars."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 166, "phrase": "At what time we will become so safe that it will be unsafe to manually operate the car, relatively speaking? And today, we were just getting in an elevator, we pressed the button for which Lori wanted, and it just takes us there safely. It would be quite alarming if elevators operated by a person with a giant switch. That’s how it will be with cars."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 168, "phrase": "Thank you. Let’s go to the next question, please."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 170, "phrase": "Next question comes from the [inaudible 00:46:11] with Wolf Research. Your line is open."}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 172, "phrase": "Hi everybody. Your costs of goods sold per vehicles are already down to the mid $37,000 range in the quarter. It’s down $5,000 year over year, despite some of the inefficiencies that you talked about. And I know that a lot is going to change from here, just given how mix is going to evolve, but if you’re successful on the structural pack and front and rear castings and the launch of the 46 80 sell, can you just maybe give us a sense of what a successful outcome would look like maybe a year from now? Obviously a lot has to go right, but just any kind of broad framework for us to think about."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 174, "phrase": "Yeah. It’s really difficult for us to make specific predictions. It’s very difficult. I think you feel confident of say at least 50% growth year over year, next year, and maybe it’s a hundred percent. We need a lot of crystal balls to figure out exactly what it’s going to be. And it is literally impossible to make a specific prediction. But you know, at least 50, maybe 100, something like that."}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 176, "phrase": "Okay. And maybe just separately from this, can you just clarify what the status is of some of the advances in battery manufacturing? Things like drag cathode mixing that you talked about on battery day? What’s the timeline? How are those evolving?"}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 178, "phrase": "Yeah. We’ve we commented on it today already actually. In the facility at Cato, over 90% of the processes have demonstrated rate there, but we are limited by the unlucky few that have not. And that’s what we’re working on. One of them that I mentioned was running the full-scale cathode colander. We’re working through some improvements that we need to make to that equipment and to the actual raw material itself to not have those limitations."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 180, "phrase": "But again, it’s an engineering problem. It’s not a question of, if it’s a question of when. On the mixing side, we haven’t actually really had any challenges specific to your question. Fundamentally, we’re still happy with the dry process direction in terms of the factory footprint, complexity, utility consumption, space and overall complexities."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 182, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 184, "phrase": "And I mean, and the cost associated with everything."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 186, "phrase": "Yeah. Don’t over-emphasize dry cathode. Maybe it’s like 10 or 15% of the cost improvement or something like that. I don’t know. 20% maybe?"}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 188, "phrase": "Oh, yeah. 10."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 190, "phrase": "Yeah. So people don’t think like, this is like the Messiah or something. You know, wet versus dry, reduces to dry as like 10% less cost than wet. So it’s not 10%, so nothing to sneeze at, especially if you’re making hundreds of gigawatt hours a year. But it’s about the Messiah, basically. Yeah."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 192, "phrase": "Thank you very much. We can go to the next question please."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 194, "phrase": "Next question comes from Pierre [inaudible 00:50:04] with New Street Research. Your line is open."}, {"author": "Speaker 6", "serial_number": 196, "phrase": "Hey, thanks so much for taking my question. I have another question actually on batteries, but on a slightly different angle. I was wondering how you’re looking at your sourcing strategy for [inaudible 00:50:21] all the work you’re doing to develop your in-house production. But what about asking other battery manufacturers to do for [inaudible 00:50:34] says with their own technology, maybe less innovation than what you guys are lining up internally. And I was wondering if the first 46 80 says that we’ll see on the road will definitely come from Tesla’s own manufacturing lines, or whether they could be coming actually from outside suppliers as well? Now, how did we put up?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 198, "phrase": "Yeah, we, we are in fact working with our existing suppliers to reduce 46 80 format cells. And this is just a guess right now, but I see us consolidating around the 46 80 nickel-based structural pack and for long range vehicles. And then not necessarily a 46 80 format, but some other format for iron based cells."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 200, "phrase": "So we kind of have the Baskin Robbins of batteries situation where there’s so many formats and so many chemistries that it’s like, we’ve got 36 flavors of a battery at this point, you know? This results in an engineering drag coefficient where each variance of cell chemistry and format requires a certain amount of engineering to maintain it and troubleshoot, and this inhibits our forward progress."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 202, "phrase": "So it is going to be important to consolidate to maybe ideally two form factors, maybe three. But ideally one nickel chemistry and one iron chemistry, so we don’t have to troubleshoot so many different variants."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 204, "phrase": "Yeah. And towards that end, we are engaging with the suppliers that we’ve had good partnerships with on 46 80 designs to enable that simplification. So far so good, they’re bringing their core competencies to bear on that. We’re not mandating what’s going on inside, but it’s been a good collaboration."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 206, "phrase": "Yeah. And we do expect to see significant increases in supply from our existing suppliers in addition to the sales that Tesla’s making. So it’s both. Sometimes I get questions from our sales suppliers of like, “Oh, are we just going to make all the cells in ourselves?” So then we’re like nope, please make as many as you possibly can and supply them to us. We have a significant unmet demand in stationary storage. Mega pack is basically sold out through the end of next year I believe."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 208, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 210, "phrase": "We have a massive backlog in Powerwall demand in Powerwall versus production is an insane mismatch. Now, part of that problem is also the semiconductor issue. So we use a lot of the same chips in the Powerwall as we do in the car. So it’s like, which one do you want to make, the cars or Powerwalls? So we need to make cars so that Powerwall production has been reduced. But as that semiconductor shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up. Powerwall production. I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of a million units of Powerwall next year. Maybe towards on the order of 20,000 a week, but again, dependent on self-supply and semiconductors."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 212, "phrase": "But in terms of demand, I think there’s probably demand for in excess of a million Powerwalls per year. And actually just a vast amounts of omega vacs for utilities. As the world transition to a sustainable energy production, solar and wind are intermittent. And by their nature really need battery packs in order to provide a steady flow of electricity. And when you look at all of the utilities in the world, this is a vast amount of batteries that are needed. That’s why long-term, we really think combined Tesla and suppliers needs to produce at least a thousand gigawatt hours a year and maybe 2000 gigawatt hours a year."}, {"author": "Speaker 6", "serial_number": 214, "phrase": "Okay, great. Thank you. And I have a quick question. I know Elon, you don’t think it’s meaningful today, but I’d be curious to know if you have any stats about when you announced a new pricing on the SAP Marine from 10 grand around to 199. I’d be curious to understand how it affected behavior issues. So like a massive effect begging the service. And I’m not thinking about people looking at this as a message, but more to try the most advanced version of autopilot and to try it. So even on Thursday on the pricing, have you seen like the ACDC can spy in the take rate? And can you give us a sense of how big it was?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 216, "phrase": "Okay. You’re asking like, is the FSD take rate too expensive? And that’s why we’re doing subscription? Or I’m not sure if I understand your question correctly."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 218, "phrase": "No, my question is from the time you announced like the subscription at 199, don’t ask the amounts. How much did the take rate increase? Like the best in business people who basically took the subscription as they booked a new car, they had to pay 10 grand in price."}, {"author": "Zack", "serial_number": 220, "phrase": "Yeah, this is Zack here. I think we’re still early in understanding how our FSD subscription will unfold, but a couple of data points here."}, {"author": "Zack", "serial_number": 222, "phrase": "So we took a look at customers in our backlog who have ordered FSD, did they cancel presumably to go to subscription apps or did they take delivery? And the level of cancellations there was not same cannibalization there. It’s possible that that changes, but that was also part of our pricing strategy at $99 and $199."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 224, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Zack", "serial_number": 226, "phrase": "Also part of our pricing strategy at $99 and $199."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 228, "phrase": "Yeah. It’s like any given the price is going to be wrong. So we’ll just adjust it over time, as we see if the value proposition makes sense to people. I’m not thinking about this a lot right now. We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 230, "phrase": "Otherwise people are kind of… Depending on the future. Like right now, if it doesn’t make sense for somebody to do FSD subscription, I think it’s debatable. But once we have full self-driving widely deployed, then the value proposition will be clear. And at that point, I think basically everyone will go use it. Or a rare individual who doesn’t."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 232, "phrase": "Okay. Thank you very much for your help. And I think that’s all the time we have for today. Thanks for all your questions. And we’ll speak to you again in three months time. Have a good day, everyone."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 234, "phrase": "Thank you."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 236, "phrase": "This concludes today’s conference call.

I will now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Martin Viecha, senior director of investor relations."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 2, "phrase": "And thank you, Carmen, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla’s first-quarter 2021 q&a webcast. I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question and answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Please press star one now if you would like to join the question to you. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 4, "phrase": "Great. Thank you. So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed a billion dollars in non-GAAP net income for the first time, and we’ve seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and our demand is the best we’ve ever seen. So if you talk about we’re used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter, and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1. So Model 3 became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world. In fact, I should say the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world. The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time the best-selling premium sedan, has been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3, and this is only three and a half years into production and was just two factories. For Model 3 to be outselling its combustion engine competitors, I think, is quite remarkable. In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly a quarter million Model 3s, which translates to annualized rate of half a million per year."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 6, "phrase": "When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world and probably next year. So I’m not 100% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely. I’d say more likely than not that in 2022, Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world. Then with regard to full self-driving, full self-driving beta continues to make great progress. It is definitely one of I think one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that’s maybe ever existed, and really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, specifically real-world artificial intelligence. And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer that was designed, but nonetheless a small computer that’s using on the order of 70 or 80 watts."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 8, "phrase": "So this is a much harder problem than if you were you, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or something like that. This has got to fit into a smaller screen, and I think with the elimination of radar, we’re finally getting rid of one of the last crutches. Radar was really … It was making up for some of the shortfalls of vision, but this is not good. You actually just need vision to work, and when your vision works, it works better than the best human because it’s like having eight cameras. It’s like having eyes in the back of your head, beside your head and has three eyes of different focal distances looking forward. This is … And processing it at a speed that is superhuman. There’s no question in my mind that with a pure vision solution, we can make a car that is dramatically safer than the average person. But it is a hard problem, because we are actually solving something quite fundamental about artificial intelligence, where we basically have to solve real-world vision AI, and we are."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 10, "phrase": "And key to solving this is also having some massive data set. So just having well over a million cars on the road that are collecting data from very sort of corner case rare situations, sort of like so many weird things in the world like a truck carrying a truck or a car with … One example is a car, as an actual example, a car with the kayak on the roof where the kayak has a little weight dangling from the front of the kayak in front of the car, but yet the car must ignore this and just look at the road. So it’s really quite tricky, but I am highly confident that we will get this done, so yes."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 12, "phrase": "This quarter, and I think we’ll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we’ve ever experienced in the life of Tesla, and same difficulties with supply chain over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage. This is a huge problem, but then in addition to that, for example, we had quite a difficulty scaling, driving our production in China because we’re unable to get critical engineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions, which meant that Tesla worldwide was dependent on drive units made at our factory in Nevada, Giga Nevada, so that was a very challenging situation. I think we’re mostly out of that particular problem. That was just two of many challenges, so the team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chain shortages."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 14, "phrase": "So with respect to the Model S and X, there were more challenges than expected in developing the Model S or what we call the Palladium program, which is the new version of Model S and X, which has a revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics and has, for example, a PlayStation 5 level infotainment system. There’s just a lot of issues encountered ensuring that the new factory was [inaudible 00:08:49], So it took quite a bit of of development to ensure that the battery of the new S/X is safe. And we’re trying to get all the [inaudible 00:09:08] in the cars slowly for the past few months, but we’re just stacking them up in the yard and just making refinements to the cars that we built."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 16, "phrase": "But we do expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month, and then to be in sort of fairly high volume production for the X in Q3 and start delivering Model X in Q3 as well. So I think as we ramp up, I think probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high, so it’s really just going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes. So probably we’re going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week. Perhaps if we get lucky, upwards of 2,400 or 2,500. This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which there’s just a lot of factors outside of our control here. But I do think this will get solved, so it’s just a matter of time and then we’ll be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week. It’s a great car. It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce, but it is a superior product."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 18, "phrase": "So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in 2021 and ’22. We’re building factories as quickly as we can. Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well, and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year. At this time, we are continuing to ramp production of Model Y in Fremont and Shanghai. In the background, we’re continuing development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, the Roadster and other products. Thanks to everyone at Tesla who made this year a huge success. Now, on to questions."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 20, "phrase": "Thank you very much. We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 22, "phrase": "Okay."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 24, "phrase": "Yes. Thanks, Martin. Thanks, Elon. So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of ’21, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons. To summarize the quarter, I think it’s best understood by three key items. First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 26, "phrase": "Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet begun customer deliveries. The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit generation. For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of the transition. And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 28, "phrase": "Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors and port capacities, while the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in the quarter, and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions to production over the course of the quarter. We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult, and it’s an evolving situation."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 30, "phrase": "If we double-click within net income. Auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved sequentially and year over year. This is in spite of the cost mentions for S and X and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace. So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as some of these headwinds we’re experiencing start to be resolved."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 32, "phrase": "On services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending toward profitability, aided by strength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb fixed overhead. On energy gross margins, these remained negative for second quarter. This is driven by solar-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease PPA business. We continue to manage through a multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall. We’re working as fast as we can to increase production, and this will aid in profitability of this business as those volumes increase. On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which is driven by our investments in technology and growth. In particular, for R&D, this includes the structural battery pack and 4680 cells, investments in the new S and X and our neural net and silicon investments."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 34, "phrase": "On the SG&A side, we’re setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA in anticipation of volume to come there. And as I said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins. Double-clicking on cash flows, we continue to generate positive free cash flows, and this was despite the significant working capital headwinds from S and X. Additionally, we are making progress reducing various forms of debt. We also invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin during the quarter, then trimmed our position by 10%, which contributed to a small gain in our Q1 financials. Taking a step back, we’ve generated $8 billion in operating cash flows and $4 billion in free cash flows over the past four quarters. As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-term growth of 50% annually, and we believe we’re on track to exceed that this year as we guided to last quarter. Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels. And so we’re driving as fast as we can to increase our production rates. As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quarters should largely be driven by execution on S and X, as we’ve discussed, continued ramp of Model Y in Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 36, "phrase": "… in Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs, and we expect profitability and cash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements. And then as we get toward the end of the year, our story will pivot toward the launch and ramp of our newest factories in Austin and Berlin. So there’s certainly no shortage of exciting things for us to work on and look forward to. Thank you, and we’ll open it up for questions."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 38, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And we’ll first take retail questions from, say, website. The first question is, how is Dojo coming along? Could Dojo unlock an AWS like business line for Tesla over the next few years?"}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 40, "phrase": "Yeah. I’ll jump in here. So with respect to Dojo …"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 42, "phrase": "Sorry, Zach. My apologies. I was on mute."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 44, "phrase": "Go ahead, Elon."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 46, "phrase": "So, yeah, I was just basically saying that although like right now people think of Tesla’s … A lot will think of Tesla as a car company or perhaps an energy company. I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company. I think we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world. Certainly, we appear to be able to use things with full self-driving that others cannot. So if you look at the evolution of what technologies we developed, we developed them in order to solve the problem of self-driving, so we couldn’t find a powerful enough neural net that runs a computer, so we designed and built our own. The software out there was really quite primitive for this task, and so we built the team from scratch and have been developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in the world."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 48, "phrase": "And then it sort makes sense that this is kind of what needs to happen because the road system is designed for a neural net computer, our brain. Our brain is neural net computer, and the entire road system is designed for vision with a neural net computer, which is because it’s designed for eyes and the brain. And so if you have a system which has very good eyes, you can see in all directions at once, you can see three focal points ahead or forward, but it never gets tired. It’s never texting. It has redundancy and its reaction time is super human, then it seems pretty obvious that such a system would achieve an extremely high level of safety, far in excess of the average person, so that’s what we’re doing."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 50, "phrase": "Then Dojo is kind of the training part of that. So because we have over a million cars, and perhaps next year we’ll have two million cars in active use, providing vast amounts of video training data that then needs to be digested by a very powerful training system. And currently, we use Tesla training software. So we developed a lot of training software, a lot of labeling software to do, to able to do surround video labeling, which is quite tricky. This means all eight cameras simultaneously at 36 range a second per camera labeling video over time. There wasn’t any tool that existed for this, so we developed our own labeling tool."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 52, "phrase": "Then taking it a step further, obviously, the Holy Grail is auto labeling. So now we’re getting quite good at auto labeling, where the trainers train the training system and then the system auto labels the data and then the human laborers just need to look at the labeling to confirm that it is correct and perhaps make edits. And then every time an edit is made, that further trains the system. So it’s kind of like a flywheel that’s just sort of spinning up, and really, the only way to do this is with vast amounts of video data. So then we need to train this efficiently, so Dojo is really a supercomputer optimized for neural net training. We think Dojo will be, probably in order of magnitude, more efficient on, say … I’m not sure what the exact right metric is, but say per frame of video, we think it will be an order of magnitude more cost efficient in hardware and in energy usage per frame of video compared to a GPU-based solution or compared to the next best solution that we’re aware of."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 54, "phrase": "So then possibly, that could be used by others. It does seem as though over time … I mean just an observation, I think basically is the fact that neural net based computing or AI-based computing is and more and more of the compute stack.Conventional computing, perhaps heuristics-based computing is still going to be important, still going to be very important, but but neural net will become a bigger and bigger portion of compute. So anyway that was a long story but I think, yeah, probably others will want to use it too and we will make it available."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 56, "phrase": "Thank you very much. Let’s go to the second question from retail investors. The recent price changes on solar roof have been discouraging for customers and investors. Could Tesla share more about solar roof challenges and if the outlook has changed at all, i.e., 1,000 roofs per week?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 58, "phrase": "Yeah. First of all, I should say that the demand for the solar roof remains strong, so despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the solar roofs. So production is going fine, but we are chocked at the inflation point. We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessing the difficulty of certain roofs, but the complexity of roofs varies dramatically. Some roofs are to be literally two or three times easier than other roofs, so you just can’t have a one-size-fits-all situation. If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is it not strong enough to hold the solar roof, then the cost can be double, sometimes three times of what our initial quotes were."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 60, "phrase": "So in those cases, what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit, but what we cannot do is go and just lose a massive amount of money. We’ve just got to provide a refund of the early deposit. But what is I think the most important about the solar roof situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we’re shifting the whole sort of solar situation, the solar power … Well, basically, solar power situation to there’s only one product basically … There’s only one configuration. We will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall. That solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solarglass Roof, but in all cases, it will have the power to … Technically, it’s actually Powerwall 2 plus, if you will. The plus refers to a higher peak power capability."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 62, "phrase": "So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak power capability than the specification on the website. They have about twice the power capability roughly. It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about arguably twice the steady-state power of the specification of the website. The energy is the same, but the power is roughly double. So all installations will have a Powerwall and the difficulty installation will dramatically … Or the difficulty of the installation will be much less. It will be much easier because the power from the solar roof, Solarglass Roof or the solar panels, will only ever go directly into the Powerwall, and the Powerwall will only ever go between the utility and the main power panel of the house, which means you never need to touch the main circuit breakers of the house. You never need to touch the house circuit breakers."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 64, "phrase": "Effectively, almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a unique work of art and requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel. So this is extremely important for scalability is. It’s the only way to do it, really, and this also means that every solar Powerwall installation that the house, or whatever the case may be, will be its own utility. And so even if all lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power, so that gives people energy security. And we can also, in working with the utilities, use the Powerwalls to stabilize the overall grid. So let’s say that there’s, like there was in Texas, there was a peak power demand, and the power demand, because the grid lacked the ability to buffer the power, they had to shut down power. There’s no power storage, no good point on power storage."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 66, "phrase": "However, with a whole bunch of Powerwalls and houses, we can actually buffer the power. And so if the grid needs more power, we can actually then, with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and in partnership with the utility, we can then actually release power onto the grid to take care of peak power demand. So effectively, the Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility. This is profound. I’m not sure how many of you will actually understand this but this is extremely profound and necessary because we are headed toward a world where, as we were just talking about earlier, where people are moving toward electric vehicles. This will mean that the power needs at homes and businesses will increase significantly. There will need to be a bunch more electricity coming somewhere."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 68, "phrase": "In fact, if you go to full renewable electricity, we need about three times as much electricity as we currently have. So these are rough numbers, but you roughly need twice much electricity if all transport goes electric, and they need three times much electricity if all heating goes electric. So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think, both for Tesla and for the utilities. And in fact, I think if this is not done, the utilities will fail to serve their customers. They won’t be able to do it. They won’t be able to react fast enough, and we’re going to see more and more of what we see, say, in California and Texas of people seeing brownouts and blackouts and the utilities not being able to respond because there’s a massive change going on with the transition to electric transport."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 70, "phrase": "And we’re seeing more extreme weather events. This is a recipe for disaster. So it is very important to have solar and batteries at the local level, at the house. In addition, it is important to have large battery storage at the utility level, so that solar and wind, which are the main forms of renewable electricity, that electricity can be stored because sometimes the wind doesn’t blow. Sometimes it blows wide. Sometimes it blows too much and sometimes it didn’t blow enough, but if you have a battery, you can store the energy and provide the energy to the grid as needed. The same goes for solar because, obviously, the sun does not shine at night and sometimes it is very cloudy, and so by having battery storage paired with solar and wind, this is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 72, "phrase": "And as I said, it needs to occur both at the local level and at the utility level. If it doesn’t occur at the local level, what will actually be required is a massive increase in power lines in power plants, so they have to put long distance and local power lines all over the place. They’ll have to increase the size of the substations. It’s a nightmare."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 74, "phrase": "Substations, it’s a nightmare. This must occur. There must be solar plus battery. That’s the only way. So yeah."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 76, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And the next retail question is master of coin. Can you tell us anything about Tesla’s future plans in digital currency space or when any such major developments might be revealed?"}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 78, "phrase": "Sure, thanks Martin. So, as I noted in our opening remarks and we have announced previously, so Tesla did invest 1.5 billion into Bitcoin in Q1, and then we subsequently sold a 10% stake in that. We also allow customers to make vehicle deposits and final vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. And so where are our Bitcoin story began, maybe just to share a little bit of context here. Elon and I were looking for a place to store cash that wasn’t being immediately used, trying to get some level of return on this but also preserve liquidity."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 80, "phrase": "You know, particularly as we look forward to the launch of Austin in Berlin and uncertainty that’s happening with semiconductors and port capacity, being able to access our cash very quickly is super important to us right now. And, you know, there aren’t many traditional opportunities to do this, or at least that we found and in talking to others that we could get good feedback on, particularly with yields being so low and without taking on additional risk or sacrificing liquidity. And Bitcoin seemed at the time, and so far has proven to be, a good decision. A good place to place some of our cash that’s not immediately being used for daily operations or maybe not needed until the end of the year. And be able to get some return on that. And I think one of the key points that I want to make about our experiences in the digital currency space is that there’s a lot of reason to be optimistic here."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 82, "phrase": "We’re certainly watching it very closely at Tesla watching how the market develops, listening to what our customers are saying, but thinking about it from a corporate treasury perspective, we’ve been quite pleased with how much liquidity there is in the Bitcoin market. So our ability to build our first position happened very quickly. When we did the sale later in March we also were able to execute on that very quickly. And so as we think about kind of global liquidity for the business in risk management, being able to get cash in and out of the markets is something that I think is exceptionally important for us. So we do believe long-term in the value of Bitcoin."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 84, "phrase": "So it is our intent to hold what we have long-term and continue to accumulate the coin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles. You know, specifically with respect to things, we may do, there are things that we’re constantly discussing. We’re not planning to make any announcements here and we’re watching this space closely. So when we’re ready to make an announcement on this front, if there’s one to come, you know, we’ll certainly let you all know."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 86, "phrase": "Thank you. And the fourth question from a retail investors is, does Tesla have any proactive plans to tackle mainstream EDS, eminent and massive and deceptive click-bait headline companies on safety of autopilot or FSD press specialty PR job of some sorts?"}, {"author": "Larson", "serial_number": 88, "phrase": "Well, I can, I’ll take this one guys, from the safety side I continue to say driving the point of- go ahead Elon- I was thinking of… Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 90, "phrase": "I think especially with just going through the facts of the… What I mean specifically, there was an article regarding a tragedy where there was high-speed accident in a Tesla, and there was really just extremely deceptive media practices, where it just blamed the autopilot which is completely false. And those journalists should be ashamed for themselves. Please go ahead. Larson."}, {"author": "Larson", "serial_number": 92, "phrase": "Yeah, thanks Elon. So I was just saying we’re committed to safety in all our designs and that’s number one in what we do here. Regarding the crash in Houston, specifically, we worked directly with the local authorities, NTSB and NITSA, wherever applicable and whenever they reach out to us for help directly on the engineering level and whatever else we can support."}, {"author": "Larson", "serial_number": 94, "phrase": "In that vein, we did a study with him over the past week to understand what happened in that particular crash. And what we’ve learned from that effort was that auto-steer did not, and could not, engage on the road condition as it was designed. Our adaptive cruise control only engaged when the driver was buckled in about five miles per hour, and it only accelerated to 30 miles per hour over the distance before the car crashed. As well, adaptive cruise control disengaged the car slowly to complete to a stop when the driver’s seatbelt was unbuckled."}, {"author": "Larson", "serial_number": 96, "phrase": "Through further investigations of the vehicle and accident remains, we inspected the car with NTSB and NITSA and the local police and we were able to find that the steering wheel was indeed deformed, leading to the likelihood that someone was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash, and all seat belts post-crash were found to be unbuckled. We were unable to recover the data from the SD card at the time of impact, but the local authorities are working on doing that and we await that report."}, {"author": "Larson", "serial_number": 98, "phrase": "As I said, we continue to hold safety in a high regard and look to improve our products in the future through this kind of data and other information from the field."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 100, "phrase": "Okay. Thank you very much. Let’s go to the next question from institutional investors. The first question is, proponents of alternative grid storage technologies claimed that lithium ion is unsuited for long-term storage at scale, due to vampire drain, could 4680 cells address this limitation? Is the limitation even relevant for charging the energy equation?"}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 102, "phrase": "Yeah. Just let me jump in on with vampire drain. That’s definitely not the issue. A good lithium ion cell self discharges, less than 0.001% of its energy per day. So it’s, vampire drain is maybe not…"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 104, "phrase": "As mythical as non-buyers."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 106, "phrase": "Yeah. I think the challenge with seasonal storage is your value proposition drops from hundreds of useful full cycles per year to less than maybe 10, or maybe even less than five cycles per year. So it’s just a different type of technology, you know, altogether. That would make sense, given that it’s more than an order of magnitude different use case."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 108, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, we’ve got a long way to go before we’re dealing with seasonal technology issues, but certainly a way to deal with seasonal technology would be to have wind and solar barring on the side of what’s more subtly latitudes, but then across a variety of longitude. So essentially, like let’s say in the U S for example, if there was a, I’m not sure if people understand this, that you can actually power the entire United States with just sort of a hundred, roughly a hundred mile by a hundred mile grid of solar."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 110, "phrase": "Sometimes people don’t quite understand like, well, how much solar is needed to power the United States. Almost nothing of this [inaudible 00:40:22] statements is true of almost any country in the world. The solar incidence is a gigawatt per square kilometer. This is insane. In fact, if you took the clear area, just the area for nuclear power plants, the area that is considered not usable because a nuclear power plant is there. In most cases, if you just put solar there it would generate more power than in the nuclear power plant who, because they typically have pretty wide clear areas. If you have say 25% efficient solar panels, and then those are 80% efficient in how they’re laid out, you’re going to do about 200 megawatts per square kilometer. Therefore, you know, five square kilometers is a gigawatt, which might be a typical sort of power plant. It’s really not much area at all. And a lot of places can have wind and solar, same place. So anyway, it’s entirely possible to power all of us with a small percentage of Earth’s area. And then to transmit that power through high voltage DC lines. No new technology. You don’t need like, room temperature superconductors… Also, other myth, room temperature superconductors are almost irrelevant in my opinion, almost irrelevant. Low cost, long distance, power lines using copper or aluminum, are just very important."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 112, "phrase": "So heating is I squared R. So that’s current squared times resistance. So as you increase voltage, you can drop the current dramatically and drop the heating dramatically to the point where it is of minor relevance. Like maybe, you lose five to seven percent with a high voltage DC power line, something like that. So I want to clear, no new physics is necessary, no new materials necessary. We just need to scale this thing up. The technologies exist today to solve renewable energy."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 114, "phrase": "And some people say, well, why don’t we do it? That’s because the energy base of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanely gigantic. So you can’t just go and do a zillion terawatts overnight. You’ve got to build the production capacity for the cells, for the battery cells, for solar cells. You’ve got to put that into vehicles. You’ve got to put that into stationary storage packs. You’ve got to put out your solar panels and solar cost roofs, and you’ve got to deploy all this stuff. But it is certainly the case that we can accelerate this and we should try to accelerate it."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 116, "phrase": "And the right thing to do I think from an economic standpoint, and I think an economist would agree, is to have a carbon tax just as we have a tax on cigarettes and alcohol, which we think are more likely to be bad than good. And we would tend to tax fruit and vegetables less. The same should be true. We should, we should tax energy that we think is probably bad and support energy you think is probably good, just like cigarettes and alcohol versus the fruits and vegetables. It’s just common sense. On the plus side, I’m not suggesting anyone to be complacent, but sustainable energy, renewable energy will be solved. It is being solved. But it matters how fast we solve it. And if we solve it faster, that’s better for the world."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 118, "phrase": "Thank you very much."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 120, "phrase": "There’s no question in my mind whatsoever that the energy storage problem can be solved with lithium ion batteries. Zero. I want to be clear. Zero. I think the bias will tend to be towards iron based lithium ion cells who, people might think, look, there must be a big constituent of the cells. It’s more like one to two percent of the cell is lithium. The main part of the cell is the cathode. The main mass and cost in the cell is the cathode. For high energy cells, for example what we use in most, most houses have have nickel based lithium-ion cells, which have higher energy density, longer range than iron based cells."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 122, "phrase": "However, stationary storage, the energy density is not as important because it’s just sitting on the ground. And so I think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron based lithium ion cells with an iron phosphate cathode, technically. But I think the phosphate part is unnecessary. It’s really just the iron or nickel. I’m misreading the terminology. Just think of it as iron and nickel, and there is an insane amount of iron in the world. More iron than we could possibly use. There’s also more lithium than we could possibly use. Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron phosphate lithium ion cells."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 124, "phrase": "Thank you very much. Let’s go through the next question from institutional investors, which is, you’ve suggested that between a five X to 10 X improvement is achievable in the automotive production versus the first model three line on the first principles physics analysis. Where does Berlin sit? Where does Berlin sit relative to that limit?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 126, "phrase": "Oh, I think we’re so we’re so quite far away from it. I mean, the thing to bear in mind with production is, for those who have never done production, they just don’t understand how insanely hard production is. I want to really be very, very emphatic here. Prototypes are trivial. They’re child’s play. Production is hard. It is very hard. Now you say production at large-scale with higher liability and low cost, insanely difficult."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 128, "phrase": "What Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car. The truly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the first American car company to achieve volume production of a car in a hundred years, and not go bankrupt. So this is, basically, myself and many others at Tesla had to basically have several aneurysms to get this done. It was so hard, no idea. So anyway, and the thing about making a large, complex manufactured object is let’s say you have-"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 130, "phrase": "The thing about making a large complex, main central object is let’s say you have trusts or approximation 10,000 unique items. If even one of those items is slow. That situate just one doesn’t matter, so trivial we’ve had production stuff because of carpet and the trunk. We have production stuff because a USB cable, at one point for wireless, we literally raided every electronics store in the bay area for, a few days there, nobody could buy a USB cable on the barrier because we, went and bought them all to put them in the car, literally. And there’s like hundreds of stories like that. So anyway, that’s the solving those constraints and, a logistics problem that makes world war II look trivial. I’m not kidding. Like the scale is insane, we told him no, he ends up cars, some massive global supply chain, 50 countries, dozens of regulatory regimes. It’s the same. So, yeah."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 132, "phrase": "Thank you. Yeah. And last question from institutional investor is master plan of part two talks about an urban transport vehicle that is smaller than traditional bus with greater aerial density achieved by removing the central aisle. Do you have any updates to share on this goal?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 134, "phrase": "Not at this time."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 136, "phrase": "Okay. Thank you very much. So let’s move to analyst Q and A."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 138, "phrase": "Thank you. First question is from Pierre. [inaudible 00:50:10]."}, {"author": "Pierre", "serial_number": 140, "phrase": "Hi guys, Thanks for taking my question. I’d love to get back to you in a day from what you presented on the battery day in the last six, seven minutes. I wasn’t very how much progress you’ve made on that first in terms of process development. So how are things coming together on your pilot line? Are you getting into the kind of production which you are aiming for? And second is actually on your production ramp. So I was wondering in which sides you’re ramping production capacities also with office 680 sale and where you stand on ramping of that capacity as well. And I’ll have a quick photo on, and I’ll just use that specimen."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 142, "phrase": "[inaudible 00:50:56] but we have the small sort of pallet plants, which is still big by normal standards, expect to have like a 10 gigawatt app for your capability and pretty much California. And were they quite a few cells? We’re not, quite yet at the point where we think cells are reliable enough to be shipped in cars, but we’re getting close to that point. And, and then we’ve already, ordered most of the equipment for battery production in Berlin and Austin as well."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 144, "phrase": "So we’re, really down to like the nitty gritty elements, but overall, I think we’re still quite optimistic about achieving volume production of the 4680 next year. [crosstalk 00:52:11]."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 146, "phrase": "There’s one thing I would add is there’s been a lot of questions about yields. Actually. I noticed people asking about that and, the yield progress has been really strong every day. And we were really still in commissioning phase with most of the tools to the point where we’re confident that the yield trajectory aligns with our internal cost projections. We just talk about yield also at better days, because there’s other reasons why it’s useful to check in on that. It takes a while, as Elon just mentioned to go from a prototype to production, and it’s not just parts it’s processes, it’s equipment, but as we’ve matured so does the the process equipment we’ve, gotten to where we need to be on the yield side."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 148, "phrase": "Yeah, basically this is just a guess, because we don’t know for sure, but it appears as though we are about 12 probably not more than 18 months away from volume production at the rate of 46 80. Now at the same time, we are actually trying to have our outsell supply of partners ramp up their supply as much as possible. So this is not something that is to the exclusion of suppliers. It is in conjunction with suppliers. So we’re super clear about that. This is not about replacing suppliers. It is about supplementing suppliers. So we have a very strong partnership with CATL with Panasonic and LG, our request to our strategic partners for sale supply is please supply with as much as you possibly can, provided the prices affordable. We will buy everything that they can make."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 150, "phrase": "Yeah. Yeah. And specific to that, we’re on track to more than double the supplier capacity over the next 13."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 152, "phrase": "Yeah exactly, we do expect from suppliers to receive double sell output next year versus this year."}, {"author": "Pierre", "serial_number": 154, "phrase": "And I had a quick follow up on maybe Zack for you on your energy business. So I understand when I get to go smudging with a sold roof ran, but I was wondering, what do gross margin look like there when you look at the storage business and where are you, what’s your ambition in terms of gross margin in in the business, as I guess it’s going to grow up to grow in the mixing in coming here. So it’s important for long-term modeling."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 156, "phrase": "Yeah. We’re, seeing a lot of [crosstalk 00:55:05]."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 158, "phrase": "We’re ending poker problem margins in storage as in, vehicle, but it is important. Bear in mind that vehicle is more mature than the storage.

Sorry, just jumping in ELon. Absolutely agree, yeah. Power wall is mature. We’ve been producing power wall two for three years now and we’re at good margins there, but Mega pack has more room to go to achieve our targets."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 164, "phrase": "We have, a clear runway for improving the customer, the megawatt hour, the mega pack."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 166, "phrase": "Absolutely. Yes, we do."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 168, "phrase": "Thank you. Let’s go to the next question, please."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 170, "phrase": "From Rod Lackey with Wolf research, please go ahead."}, {"author": "Rod Lackey", "serial_number": 172, "phrase": "Hi everybody. I was hoping maybe you just first, you could talk a little bit about how you’re thinking about the rollout of version nine of SSD and the transition to the subscription model. It sounds like some, of this is about to roll out next month. I’m not sure if that’s a subscription model, but maybe you could just spend a little time talking about how impactful you expect that to be?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 174, "phrase": "So I got, go ahead again. Yeah."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 176, "phrase": "We’re working on getting SSD subscription out and there’s a couple of internal technical dependencies. But from a business model perspective, that’s aligned and we’re hoping to roll that out soon. The key thing that I say here that there’s a lot of potential for recurring revenue based on an SSD subscription. The, if you look at the size of our fleet and you look at the number of customers who did not purchase SSD upfront or on a lease, and maybe want to experiment with SSD is a great option for them. One of the things we’ll need to keep an eye on is a potential transition from cash purchases of SSD subscription over to cash purchases of SSD who may move over to SSD subscription. And so there could be a period of time in which, cash reduces in the near term. And then as the portfolio of subscription customers built up, then that becomes a pretty strong business for us over time. But we’re hoping to get this launched pretty soon and, see what the response is to it."}, {"author": "Rod Lackey", "serial_number": 178, "phrase": "Okay, great. And I was hoping Zach, maybe you can just talk a little bit about APEX. It was a noticeable increase, even excluding SPC, obviously a lot going on this quarter, but can you maybe just talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about that going forward?"}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 180, "phrase": "Sure. On the R and D side, what we’re seeing, as I mentioned in my opening remarks is kind of a convergence of a series of programs that are happening and in our R and D APEX spend kind of correlates to where we are in the product life cycle on different programs. And so we’re kind of at the tail end of the investments and what we call internally palladium, which is the new model S and model X. And, so we expect that to decrease over time, but it was high in Q1 for a lot of the reasons that Elon had mentioned, we’re also getting very heavy into 46 80 development that the end team are working on in the associated structural battery pack that goes along with that. So these are new technologies, not only new to Tesla, but new to the industry."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 182, "phrase": "And so we’re investing heavily there on an R and D side to work out those kinks and, spend along, in those areas, should continue over time as we continue to work through the development cycle of those. And then I also mentioned, Elon talks a bit about, dojo and the potential there. So from neural net investments and custom Silicon investments, these continue to be areas that we spend on and make investments in. On the SGNA side the business is pivoting very quickly to be global. And China is ramping quite quickly and, we’re trying to make sure that we are staying ahead of the volume so that we have the right sales capacity store capacity there, local investments. In IT and others to manage the growth."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 184, "phrase": "Such that as the growth comes, the execution challenges are smaller than maybe in similar periods of growth that we’ve seen in the past. And, we’re making investments there ahead of the growth and in overall. And so we looked at APEX as a percentage of revenue over the course of the year. We do expect to see a substantial drop from 2020 to 2021 as the volumes in the latter part of the year pickup."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 186, "phrase": "Thank you. Let’s go through the next question, please."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 188, "phrase": "Thank you from Dan Leavey with credit Suisse. Your line is open."}, {"author": "Dan ", "serial_number": 190, "phrase": "Hi, good evening. Thanks, to two questions. One is on cogs. I think we’ve gotten from battery day a pretty good feel about the potential for cogs reduction related to powertrain, but I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing cogs ex powertrain. Is it still need a meaningful reduction on that front to make the math work on a $25,000 vehicle? So what levers do you have to reducing your cost X powertrain? Is it just more scale, better supplier pricing, or is it just based on ongoing cost reduction?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 192, "phrase": "I think all of the above."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 194, "phrase": "I mean, on the vehicle side, there’s plenty of opportunity as well. Obviously building a car like a model S that’s quite complex and has various moving parts, model three and model Y were steps of improvement in that. But when you look at some of the other advancements that we’re including in the model, Y factories into Austin and Berlin, we’ve reduced the body pipe count by as much as 60% of the part cost money. So we continue to find optimizations there as well as we get economies of scale. When we start to talk about the volumes, we’re considering worldwide with four factories building the same vehicle. So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve our cogs as well. And, powertrain continues to be integrated into that."}, {"author": "Dan ", "serial_number": 196, "phrase": "Great. And then just related, as BC Berlin and an Austin ramp, but I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont non optimized, because you bought the old NUMMI facility you had to retrofit that to your need. So maybe you can give us a sense of how your new capacity is going to differ versus Fremont. What are the areas that you have efficiencies that you previously didn’t have and maybe, how much does that add up to improve cogs over time to help you achieve that $25,000 vehicle?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 198, "phrase": "Yeah, we won’t talk too much about spiritual product development, conference calls are not, the right place to make major part announcements, but yeah, we’ll get there, but we’ll provide later."}, {"author": "Martin", "serial_number": 200, "phrase": "Oh, all right. Thank you very much. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for today. Thank you very much for dialing in and for listening. And we’ll speak to you again in about three months. Thank you. Bye."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 202, "phrase": "Thanks sir."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 204, "phrase": "This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}]}

TSLA Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript", "url": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/tesla-inc-tsla-q4-2020-earnings-call", "replicas": [{"author": "Sherry", "serial_number": 0, "phrase": "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Tesla’s Q4 2020 financial results and Q&A webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star-one on your telephone. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. If you require any further assistance, please press star-zero. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, senior director of investor relations. Please go ahead, sir."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 2, "phrase": "Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla’s fourth-quarter 2020 Q&A webcast. I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question and answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one followup, and please press star-one now if you’d like to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 4, "phrase": "Thank you. So just to recap the year. 2020 was a defining year for us on many levels. Despite a challenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5 million cars. I’d just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort. We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history, so really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging 2020, so my hat is off to such hard work with such great people at Tesla."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 6, "phrase": "And full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3 billion on building new factories and other expenditures. We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow. Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity. We started producing the model out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed. We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly. We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles. We started and we’re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings for Model Y. This is where, for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made. We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year. We’re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year. And lastly, we built a battery cell factory in the Bay Area."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 8, "phrase": "And even though it is a pilot plant, its capacity is large enough that it would be probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant. Regarding the new Model S and X, we’re super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X pad are in production now and will be delivered in February. So we’ve been able to bring forward the pad Model S and X, and Model S will be delivered in February and Model X a little later. The Model S pad, and we’re actually in production now, and we’ll be delivering next month. So this is a tri motor Model S with a completely new interior. There are actually a lot of great things about this. I’ll do another call about the Model S later, but it’s really a tremendous improvement over the prior version."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 10, "phrase": "And the Model S pad will be the first production car ever that is able to go 0 to 60 miles an hour in under two seconds. So no production car ever has been able to get below two seconds zero to 60. This is a luxury stand that is able to go 0 to 60 in less than two seconds and will have the ability to seat up to seven people with the third row seats, so this is pretty nice. This is faster to be clear than any car. It’s not like there was a different type of car, like a two-door sports car that was able to do that. This is the fastest accelerating car ever made that is allowed to go on roads in history. And like I say, we’ll start delivering it in a matter of weeks. We’ll obviously get into the details what the Model S changes maybe later this week or next, but it’s really better in many ways."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 12, "phrase": "We will be actually raising the price of Model S for these new models. If you have the old model, the new model will be $10,000 more, so hopefully people aren’t too upset if they bought the old model last month, but this one’s $10,000 more. So yeah, we think it’s probably the best car of any kind at any price available in the world today. So then with regard to full self-driving, we’ve made massive progress on Full Self-Driving. I recommend watching the videos of our public beta. So we’ve got, I think, almost 1,000 people in the beta at this point. And with each successful release of the beta FSD software, it’s really improving rapidly."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 14, "phrase": "It’s not very common for … I drive the latest build. It’s very common for me to have no interventions on drives that I do, including drives to a place that I’ve never been to. So these are not preplanned routes. The car has never been there before, and it’s now actually more common than not for the car to have no interventions, even on a complex drive. Basically, I’m highly confident the car will drive itself for the reliability in excess of a human this year. This is a very big deal, and thinking about like how does one justify the value of the company being where it is? And I think there is a way, just with back of the on road map to potentially justify it, where if Tesla ships, let’s say, hypothetically, $50 billion or $60 billion worth of vehicles, and those vehicles become full self-driving and can be used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an average of 12 hours a week to potentially an average of 60 hours a week, if they’re capable of serving as robotaxi. So that’s like roughly a five times increase in utility."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 16, "phrase": "But even if you say like, “Okay, let’s just assume that the car becomes twice as useful,” not five times as useful, but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of the company, which is almost entirely gross margin. So it would mean, it would be like if you made $50 billion worth of cars, it will be like having $50 million of incremental profit basically from that because it’s just software. If that’s the case, then you get 20 PE on that, it’s like $1 trillion and the company is still in high-growth mode. So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of the company where it is using just the cars and nothing else, the cars with FSD, and I suspect at least some number of investors are taking that approach."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 18, "phrase": "So in conclusion, while 2020 was a turning point for Tesla and in terms of profitability, we believe this is just the beginning. We think 2021 is going to be even more exciting, and you don’t know what to expect in a given year. Obviously, last year, we did not hear many things, we do not expect. But assume that ’21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint. I think it’s going to be a great year for Tesla. We’ve got many great new products coming out. We’ve got factories that are advanced factories out of [inaudible 00:09:54] production."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 20, "phrase": "It will also make it easier how you’re having a factory in Berlin, one, in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint. Texas can help supply the eastern half of the U.S., and Berlin can help supply Europe. And there’s just pure cars on both, much less capital tied up with big cars that have been transported to customers. I think the fundamental efficiency of the company will be much better with the factories or at least having factories on each continent and having two factories in the U.S. So I’m super excited about the future, and yes, we look forward to making it happen. Thank you."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 22, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And I think our CFO, Zach Kirkhorn, has some opening remarks as well."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 24, "phrase": "Yeah. Thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, 2020 has been an extremely successful year while managing through many unforeseen and unexpected challenges. On cash, we continue to generate strong free cash flows, reaching a record $1.9 billion in Q4 alongside growth and investment for future programs. Additionally, we’ve been able to reduce our use of debt and various working capital lines, including settling $2 billion of convertible debt in Q4, which will continue into Q1. For net income, we achieved our first calendar year and six sequential quarters of profitability. In addition, auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved from 2019 to 2020 despite reductions in ASP and inefficiencies from new product launches and transitions."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 26, "phrase": "On Q4 specifically, this was a noisy quarter so let’s unpack a few things. Stock-based comp increased, part of which is driven by the rise of the stock price over the course of our 2020 employee performance grant process, and a portion of which is unique to Q4 only. The impact of SBC increases is seen across both COGS as well as operating expenses. Automotive gross margin in Q4 was primarily impacted by two things: First, we invested in improving our products built in Fremont, including converting over to the new Model S and Model X, launching the single-piece castings on Model Y, and introducing heat pump on Model 3."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 28, "phrase": "Second, logistics and labor costs were impacted due to supply chain instability and pandemic inefficiencies. Adjusting for items such as these as we do in our internal management views, we saw an improvement in auto gross margin. Our services and other P&L was impacted by many of the same factors just mentioned, including onboarding costs associated with new service capacity. However, what’s most important here is that we’ve accelerated the growth in service capacity and will continue to drive capacity expansion as fast as possible. On energy gross margin, we saw an impact from Solar Roof-related ramp costs and typical seasonality in the lease PPA business. OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce despite impacts from items mentioned as well as increased investment in development of future products."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 30, "phrase": "Finally, the early settlement of our convertible notes resulted in an additional $100 million of interest expense for the quarter. All that being said, nothing has changed about our view that operating margin will continue to grow and remain industry-leading. As we look forward, 2021 may be our most meaningful step forward yet as we see the benefits of long-standing investments in capacity and technology. The range of possible outcomes this year is wide, given the magnitude of launches. There’s a few things we should keep in mind. We continue to expect a long-term volume CAGR of 50%, of which we may materially exceed this in 2021. As we increase production rates, volumes will skew toward the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will be a part of this year’s story and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 32, "phrase": "Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products. Additionally, we’re working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage as well as port capacity, which may have a temporary impact. We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including OpEx as a percentage of revenue. Global demand continues to outpace production, and we’re moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long term. I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 34, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And now we can jump straight into questions from Say Technologies. The first question from institutional investors is what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share leader in solar?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 36, "phrase": "Yeah. So we’re actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter over quarter last year, and we had our best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4. So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it. Unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building. We had to take the whole company, including a bunch of people that were on solar and had to work on cars, but now we’ve got a little more bandwidth, we’re putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly. So I think it will not be long before Tesla is by far the market leader in solar."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 38, "phrase": "Another really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure, which then allows us to have industry-leading pricing. And so that’s something that we’ve accomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be. And as Elon mentioned, this is a really important part within …"}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 40, "phrase": "And I think I mentioned, this is a really important part with industry-leading pricing to become the leader in this space."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 42, "phrase": "Yeah. And actually, an important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar and Tesla Roof. And we’re confident we’ll have excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar whether it’s retrofit, or the [inaudible 00:16:30] Roof before the end of the year. So I think we’ve got a good strategy. As Zach mentioned, we’re focused on reducing the amount of time and the complexity of the install, and we’re making great progress in that regard. And I think we’ll have something that’s really dialed in this year."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 44, "phrase": "Thank you. The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to their next vehicle? This would be a huge for loyalty and overall increase sales of vehicles who are offering more FSD sales on use vehicles."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 46, "phrase": "Unfortunately, we’re not considering that at this time. We do actually offer a higher price for a car with the FSD than the one without FSD. And I do think that the market currently undervalues… The consumer market, and arguably the stock market, does probably undervalue just how good FSD is going to be. But we’re not currently planning allowing it to get transferred."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 48, "phrase": "Thank you."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 50, "phrase": "We will be offering subscription pretty soon in the next month or two. So that should address a lot of people’s concerns for being able to get it."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 52, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And the third question is, can you give us a progress update on dry coating of the battery electrodes. At the Battery Day, Elon said, “I would not say this is completely in the bag, as yet as the yields were low.”"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 54, "phrase": "Andrew?"}, {"author": "Andrew", "serial_number": 56, "phrase": "Yeah, sure. It’s true, the in-house cell manufacturing system we revealed at Battery Day contains new processes and equipment. So we did expect some unknown unknowns and technical challenges to arise through the production ramp. The Kato team, however, has been able to solve each manufacturing problem presented to date, and continues to improve yield and rate week-over-week and month-over-month as we move up the production S-Curve. At the same time, the cell engineering teams refined designs, and deepened understanding has reinforced our confidence in the drive process and 4680 design, meeting our performance and cost targets."}, {"author": "Andrew", "serial_number": 58, "phrase": "And from a capacity perspective, we have 10 gigawatt hours worth of equipment landed at Kato. The production staff is nearly all hired. Our material supply chain is established, and the team is on track for full production ramp this year. Meanwhile, we’ve developed enough engineering confidence with our 4680 design and the production process and equipment to kick off manufacturing equipment and facility construction to support our 100 gigawatt hour 2022 goal."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 60, "phrase": "Okay, thank you very much. The next question is why are you confident Tesla will achieve Level 5 autonomy in 2021? And why is Dojo not necessary to get there?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 62, "phrase": "I guess I’m competence based on my understanding of the technical roadmap and the progress that we’re making between each beta iteration. Yeah. As I was saying, it’s not remarkable at all for the car to completely drive you from one location to another through a series of complex intersections. It’s now about just improving the corner case reliability and getting it to 99.9999% reliable, with respect to an accident. Basically, we need to get it to better than human by a factor of at least 100% or 200%. And this is happening rapidly because we’ve got so much training data with all the cars in the field. And the software is improving dramatically. We also write the software for [inaudible 00:20:47]. And I’ll say, it is quite challenging. We’re moving everything towards video labeling"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 64, "phrase": "So all video labeling for video inference. And so there’s still a few of the neural nets that need to be upgraded to video training and video inference. And really, as we transition to each net to video, the performance has become exceptional. So this is a hard thing. The labeling software that we work for, video labeling, making that better has a huge effect on the efficiency of labeling. And then, of course, the Holy Grail is auto labeling. So we’re putting a lot of work into having the labeling tool be more efficient when used by a person, as well as enabling auto labeling, where we can. Dojo is a training supercomputer. We think it may be the best neural net training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude. So it is a whole thing in and of itself. And this is something we could offer potentially as a service. So some of the others need neural net training. We’re not trying to keep it to ourselves."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 66, "phrase": "So I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself. And then, of course, for training vast amounts of video data, and getting the reliability from 100% to 200% better than an average human to 2,000% better than average human. So that will be very helpful in that regard."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 68, "phrase": "Thank you. The next question is what is Tesla’s current gigawatt-hour run rate of of the 4680 cell production? How do you see these run rate evolving by mid-2021 or end of 2021?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 70, "phrase": "I think we kind of talked about that through. Essentially, what we’re saying is that the number to think about or focus on is we’ve got a 100 gigawatt-hour total that Tesla cells produced in 2022. It’s not that important to look at the run-up to that, because these things tend to improve exponentially. But we are installing capacity, in 2022, for 200 gigawatt hours a year, and we think probably we should be able to achieve 30% of targeted design capacity in 2022."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 72, "phrase": "Yeah. Yeah. Agreed, Elon. And as you’ve said before, with the S-Curve of production, you can be off a little bit on the initial part of the S-Curve, and that makes a difference in absolute capacity by quite a bit, one month to the next. So, yeah, we are progressing up that S-Curve as fast as we possibly can."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 74, "phrase": "Yeah. And we don’t see any showstoppers."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 76, "phrase": "Yep."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 78, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And one more question is from retail investors. What is Tesla doing to improve service experience? Tesla had a reputation for outstanding customer service. Now it’s impossible to even call a service center, and appointments are scheduled weeks out. Jerome."}, {"author": "Jerome", "serial_number": 80, "phrase": "Yes. Well, as far as best service, no service. So we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the quality and the reliability of our cars. In the last two years, the frequency of services visits are reduced by one-third. So customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, no service. And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible. One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in North America. We’re trying to push that to 50% this year. 50% of service visits last less than two hours."}, {"author": "Jerome", "serial_number": 82, "phrase": "So we’re trying to service the cars very quickly, so people can get their vehicles back on the road. And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve. We have actually 140 service centers right now in North America. For 100 out of those 140, you can get appointments in less than 10 days. And we’re going to make sure it’s all service centers have short wait time. We’re accelerating, as Zach mentioned earlier, the pace of opening. In North America, we opened 11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year. So that’s what we’re doing to improve service."}, {"author": "Jerome", "serial_number": 84, "phrase": "In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app. Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the Tesla app, and we’re trying to move away from the phone. The app is much better than the phone. It can spot directly alerts, directly from the car and schedule a service appointment. And there is a written record of all communication between the customer and the service team. You can have pictures in there. You can take care of your payments without entering the credit card and doing all that stuff. You get updates on the service. And there’s even more features that are going to come in the coming months on the app, and I think everybody will be happy, including the ability to spot where your service technician is, and how far it is to coming from your car and what’s going on there. So we are investing everything on the app, I think just like most other companies as well. And that’s the way of the future."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 86, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And now let’s go to institutional investor questions. The question number one, what are the key milestones we need to achieve in order to evolve current FSD to a commercial Level 4, Level 5 ride sharing solution?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 88, "phrase": "Yeah. So it really goes back to what I was saying a moment ago, which is, we need to transition over the neural nets in the car to a video. And in order to do that, the whole stack has to be changed to video. That means gathering video clips, then using… And this is actually surround video. So you’ve got eight cameras operating simultaneously with synchronized frame rates. So you’ve got basically eight camera around video. And then you’ve got to label basically everything in that video snippet, and then train against that, and then have those neural nets operate the car. And this is coming from the past where we would label… The neural nets would be a single camera, single frame. So no video, and not combining the cameras. And then we went from a single frame, one frame at a time, one camera at a time neural nets, to surround camera… Neural nets would look at all eight cameras, but only one frame at a time, and now to where we include the time dimension, and that’s video."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 90, "phrase": "So I really just see this as a question of getting the work done, we’re getting it done, and you can see the results in the rapidly improving FSD betas that are released. And we’re also going to be expanding the FSD beta itself to include more and more people. So from my standpoint, it looks like a very clear and obvious path towards a vehicle that will drive 100% safer than a person. Yeah. I really don’t see any obstacles here."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 92, "phrase": "Thank you. Thank you. And the second question from institutionals is, does Tesla plan or expect to license any of its software applications, FSD, and Autobidder in particular, to third-party OEMs?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 94, "phrase": "I think we are very open to licensing our software to third parties. And we’ve had some preliminary discussions about licensing autopilots to other OEMs. So this is something we’re more than happy to do. But I think, obviously, we need to probably do a little bit more work to prove that Tesla autopilot is capable of full self-driving, which, like I said, I think will become obvious later this year. And then we’re more than happy to license that to other car companies. We’re definitely not trying to keep it to be a Tesla exclusive situation. And I think the probably same goes to Autobidder. We haven’t thought as much about Autobidder. But the Tesla philosophy is definitely not to create walled gardens. We’re going to allow other companies to our supercharger networks. And yeah, using our autonomy software and Autobidder, and perhaps other things, would be fine too."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 96, "phrase": "Thank you. The next question is, key differences in product customer preferences, FSD strategy between China and the rest of the world. Do we need to do things differently to win the Chinese EV markets?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 98, "phrase": "Well, we are currently the leader in the Chinese EV market. So I think we must be doing something right if we’re the best selling electric car in China. That said, very few of our customers in China. I admit, maybe as low as one or 2%, actually have selected the FSD option. This is much lower than rest of the world. So we definitely need to make it work well in China. I think, some of it works well in China, then we will have a [inaudible 00:31:53] for FSD. I find the customers in China, Tesla owners in China, are among the most discerning in the world."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 100, "phrase": "… in China are among the most discerning in the world. The attention to detail is incredible. I’m confident that they will buy [inaudible 00:32:14] worked in long term. And hopefully, that is later this year."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 102, "phrase": "Thank you. And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about the company’s long-term earnings power is tied to profit per unit of battery capacity? Three terawatt hours targets from battery, they imply is half of long-term battery capacity goes through storage, depending on what you assume for Packsize on the Elon’s 20 million vehicle unit goals."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 104, "phrase": "Yeah, it is. So, the fundamental limits on electric vehicles right now, in general, is availability of cells. What’s the output of battery cells in jiggawat hours, and you can’t grow faster than that. Now, at Tesla we’ve improved the efficiency of our product dramatically, such that you can actually get pretty good range, even with the standard range e-pack. It’s projected for model three, it’s approaching the high two hundreds. And, with some slight continued improvements, we’ll get to the 300 mile range to a standard pack, and [inaudible 00:33:34] 500 kilometers."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 106, "phrase": "So, the efficiency improvements in the car. But fundamentally the growth is dependent on cell production. And there’s actually a lot of other companies that want to, that have a need for cells. So, the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth. It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers. In fact, I want to be really clear Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers. And we’ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL, or Panasonic, or LG, that we will take as many batteries as they can produce."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 108, "phrase": "And we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us. Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable. But I’m trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers, it is to supplement our suppliers. And we want to have suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition, have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 110, "phrase": "So, it’s acceleration over and above what the most that our suppliers would say they can produce for us. And so, probably since the cell output drives vehicle output, then probably the broad brushstroke value of Tesla is just, what’s the set off of [inaudible 00:35:32] that vehicle output. And then, at least double that for autonomy revenue. Probably won’t’ level, and that’s how you figure out the value of the company in the long term."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 112, "phrase": "Thank you very much. The next question is about 46/80 cells, which we already covered in the retail section of this call. So, let’s go straight to the last question from Institutional Investors, which is, “Where are you in cyber truck development? What are your expectations for cyber truck deliveries in 2021?”"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 114, "phrase": "Right. So, we’re finished with the cyber truck engineering. So, we’re no longer iterating at the design center level or the line level. We’ve got design specs, we’re getting to order the equipment necessary to make the cyber truck work. We’re actually going to be using even bigger testing machines for the rear body of cyber truck, because you’ve got a bigger vehicle and you’ve got a long truck bed that’s going to split a lot of load."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 116, "phrase": "So, we’ll be using an 8,000 tons casting press for the rear body casting as opposed to 6,000 tons for a Model Y. So, 6,000 tons was the biggest cast Tesla mold, 8,000 tons is quite a bit bigger than that. And I think it’s an incredible vehicle. If we get lucky, we’ll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year. But I expect volume production to be in 2022."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 118, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And now, we can start with questions in the queue."}, {"author": "Operator", "serial_number": 120, "phrase": "Thank you. Our first question will come from Colin Rush with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Colin Rush", "serial_number": 122, "phrase": "Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the regulatory environment for FST and how you’re seeing that play out? Obviously, it’s a bit of a moving target right now, and you guys are leading the way here, but we’d love to understand how those conversations are going and how you see that impacting the roll out of FST throughout the balance of this year and into next year."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 124, "phrase": "Okay. Zach, do you want to [inaudible 00:37:56]?"}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 126, "phrase": "Well, what we’re seeing right now in the US, for example, is a pretty dynamic space. But it’s overall not particularly limiting on a rule basis, but what we’re going to expect is to have to work with regulators to demonstrate really, really high reliability, as Elon said before, the rest of the world’s fairly dynamic. In Europe, we see a general slowdown, generally not reaching past level three right now, with some impetus to start working on new working groups, to reach past that."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 128, "phrase": "And China’s showed an interest in working on level four or even level five later this year. So, we expect a pretty dynamic 2021 in the regulatory space. We have leadership in the US looking for manufacturers to demonstrate really good launches and really high reliability before releasing to wider and wider groups."}, {"author": "Colin Rush", "serial_number": 130, "phrase": "Thanks, guys. And then, just a quick follow up around inflation on some of the materials markets. Obviously, there’s a lot going on as low interest rates flow through the basic materials space. Can you talk a little bit about the supply chain and how you’re mitigating some of your exposure around some of your raw material costs?"}, {"author": "Jerome", "serial_number": 132, "phrase": "This is Jerome. Yeah. For supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions from COVID and the shipping in particular, both between Asia and North America. But we’re also looking forward to pricing, and we’re watching this very closely for all the components. We are entering a series of long-term agreements with preferred suppliers to ensure that you’re going to have enough quantity to support the growth 50%, as Zach mentioned earlier, but also good pricing with appropriate sharing of the risks."}, {"author": "Operator", "serial_number": 134, "phrase": "Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse, please go ahead."}, {"author": "Dan Levy", "serial_number": 136, "phrase": "Hi, good evening. Thank you. Two questions, one on ’21 and just one on capital. First, on ’21. Any expectations for what we should see on regulatory credit sales? And then the second question is on capital. Obviously you’ve raised a lot of capital in 2020, what should we think about the use of those funds beyond just covering some of the maturities? And can you just give us a sense of what the elevated liquidity does and doesn’t buy? Meaning, to what extent does elevated capital enable you to accelerate plans on building capacity or expanding vertical integration, accelerating on for self-drive features? So, those are the questions. Thank you."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 138, "phrase": "Sure. On the regulatory and credit sales side, this is always an area that’s extremely difficult for us to forecast. 2020 regulatory credit sales ended up being higher than expectations. And it’s difficult to give guidance on that. I mean, what I’ve said before is that in the long-term, regulatory credit sales will not be a material part of the business, and we don’t plan the business around that."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 140, "phrase": "It’s possible that for the handful of additional quarters, it remains strong. It’s also possible that it’s not. Most of our regulatory credit revenue from Q4 was not lined up prior to the beginning of the quarter, in these sort of discrete deals that were struck over the course of the quarter. So, I wish I could give you more on this, Dan, but it’s a space that’s extraordinarily difficult for us to forecast."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 142, "phrase": "On the second side of it with respect to capital, a couple of things that we’re thinking through there. So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, debt reduction is an important thing that we’re focused on now. Early conversions, these are things we don’t have a choice on. We did around 2 billion of that in Q4, we currently have 1.4 billion that we expect to go out in Q1 as a result of early conversions or conversions on convertible debt. That number may increase. And so, debt reduction is important, that’s helpful in interest expense as well."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 144, "phrase": "We are also using the money with respect to our investments in future capacity. And so, what we’re able to do now that we haven’t had the opportunity to do in the past is as we’re building capacity, particularly in Austin and Berlin. We can build that capacity with the expectation of what the end state of capacity will be, pulling forward some of those investments, rather than incrementally adding capacity as we go along. And so, this is an important part in terms of capital efficiency that we haven’t had the luxury to do in the past. And it’s great to be able to have the liquidity to focus on that."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 146, "phrase": "And then, more broadly, as Jerome was touching on service expansion, that’s really important to the future strategy of the company. So, as you saw in our Q4 numbers, the expansion of service centers and mobile service from Q3 to Q4 increased quite a bit and was also quite a bit higher than the first part of the year. And so, we’re able now to make investments there and also in the supercharging network to get ahead of future demand, which will cost us more in the near term, but is what the right long-term thing is for our customers and the company."}, {"author": "Operator", "serial_number": 148, "phrase": "Thank you. Our next question will come from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler, please go ahead."}, {"author": "Alex Potter", "serial_number": 150, "phrase": "Great, thanks. Was wondering, you mentioned how you’d like to increase your purchases of cells from suppliers. Does this require them to also have the capability to build structural 40/60/80 cells of the sort that you’re putting in these newer iterations of vehicles?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 152, "phrase": "No, it does not. Although we are talking with them about making the 40/60/80 point factor, it is not required. For example, the new S Car B uses the 18650 form factor. So, that’s just a more advanced cell. And we think we’ll continue to use that form factor for at least a few years, but we will over time be retiring the form factors and trying to move to a consistent form factor. But it is not a requirement that we place on our suppliers, because it just results in fewer cells. So, it’s better for us to deal with the complexity of different cell form factors than insist on a single form factor for our suppliers today. Like I said, over time, it will make sense to have a consistent form factor."}, {"author": "Alex Potter", "serial_number": 154, "phrase": "Okay. Makes sense. And then one additional maybe qualitative question on capacity expansion, you’ve mentioned in the past, I mean, access to dollars is one thing, but access to human beings that are sufficiently qualified is another. Have you run up against any issues on that front that would potentially limit your growth in any way? Thanks."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 156, "phrase": "That is one of the things that limits to growth rates. It doesn’t limit the ultimate size, but limits the growth rate, which is the rate at which we can onboard great people and get them trained in the right areas. You usually can’t, like instantaneously, if you’ve got a factory that has 20,000 employees, you can’t just hire 20,000 people instantly. They’ll usually bring something else. So, they’ve got to transition from whatever they were doing or move from some other part of the country. And so, there’s a certain amount of time required for that."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 158, "phrase": "That said, we do think that we can maintain a growth rate in excess of 50% per year, for many years to come. At least we’re producing here for many years to come. I think this year we may attract to a fair bit about 50%, but we don’t want to commit to that. But at least that’s what it would appear, and the same again next year, it appears to be hopefully about 50%."}, {"author": "Operator", "serial_number": 160, "phrase": "Thank you. Our next question will come from Joseph Speck with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Joseph Speck", "serial_number": 162, "phrase": "Thanks. Elon, back in 2018, you tweeted about electric vans and how it could be interesting to work with Diane Lornepriner. We haven’t really heard of anything since, but in the meantime, we’ve seen a lot of activity in that electric van and last mile space from a number of established players and startups. So, I know you said that you have a lot of projects on the table, but can you provide us an update of your thoughts on this market? And is it something you’re interested in?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 164, "phrase": "I think Tesla is definitely going to make an electric van at some point. Some things to bear in mind is that there is fundamentally a constraint on battery cell output. So, if you’re not involved in manufacturing, it’s really hard to appreciate just how hard is this to scale production. It’s just the hardest thing in the world. Prototypes are easy, scaling production is very hard. So, a big part of the reason, the main reason we have not accelerated new products is, like for example, the Tesla semi, is that we simply don’t have enough cells for it. If we were to make-"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 166, "phrase": "… our cells group. If we were to make the semi like right now, which we could easily go into production with the semi, but we would not have enough to cells built for it right now. We will have enough cells for Semi when we are producing the 4680 volume. But for example, Semi would use typically five times the number of cells that a car would use, but it would not sell for five times what a car would sell for. So it kind of doesn’t make … It would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint. The same would go for that."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 168, "phrase": "Okay. Thank you. And then maybe if I could dig into your past on one more item. About two years ago, at the Autonomy Day, you stated that you’re working on the next-gen Tesla chip which was about two years away. So is there any update on that front?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 170, "phrase": "Yeah, to be clear, the software still does not fully use the capabilities of the FSD version one computer. It is really just an incredibly powerful computer, and I am personally certain that you can create full self-driving with safe Level 5 [inaudible 00:49:23] just using the full self-driving Version 1 computer. The Version 2, we expect to be about three times as powerful, and this needs to be paired with higher resolution cameras. And so it requires a bunch of things to change simultaneously. But we have not been rushing the Version 2 of the chip. It’s coming along well, and it’s in good shape, but since we can achieve FSD, full self-driving, with the current system, it would actually be a distraction right now if we were to introduce the Tesla FSD chip 2 because it would set us back quite a bit on software, and software is the critical path to full self-driving. So I wouldn’t worry too much about that. That’s an improvement but not a game changer. That has to be changed. Getting the software to work and getting all the neural nets to the video, that’s the game changer."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 172, "phrase": "Thank you. Our next question will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Emmanuel Rosner", "serial_number": 174, "phrase": "Thank you very much. My first question is about your in-house cell manufacturing efforts. So in addition to building up capacity, some of the goals you highlighted was to cut the pricing or the cost by about 50%, boost the range by about 50% over a number of years. So wanted to know if your initial efforts are trending in that direction? What is, sort, of like the timeline to achieve these goals? And maybe related to this, how are you thinking about the time line for the cheaper Tesla, the entry model, eventually?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 176, "phrase": "I think we feel very confident about achieving those targets, let’s say, over a three-year time frame. I don’t know. It’s not like year one. So three, maybe four years, give ourselves a little room. But for three or four years, I’d say."}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 178, "phrase": "Yeah. We put together the trajectory in the Battery Day, and we’re on that trajectory still. I think that’s probably the best reference for the cost trajectory that we are on."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 180, "phrase": "Yeah. We’re aspiring to do better than Battery Day, but we are confident of at least for doing what we presented at Battery Day."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 182, "phrase": "Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Kallo with Baird. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Ben Kallo", "serial_number": 184, "phrase": "Hey, guys. Thank you, Elon. Congrats to the whole team. So we’re trying to put together all the breadcrumbs. If I remember correctly, going back 10 years, you talked about when you have a mass market car on the road, that you’d step down as CEO and be a chief architect. And then we have, you go into Hawaii, subsea lair and the x.com, and I’m trying to put it all together. There’s a lot of questions there. Thank you."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 186, "phrase": "Sure. Well, I expect to be CEO of Tesla for several years, so I think there’s still a lot that I’m super excited about doing, and I think it would be hard to leave a lot of these great projects halfway or part like hallway done. So I do expect to be running the company for several years into the future. Now obviously, nobody is or should be CEO forever, so I don’t expect to be. The sheer amount of work required to be CEO of Tesla is insane, and I think I definitely do more technical work than is typical for a CEO. So it would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands as opposed to just working day and night, from when I wake up to when I go to sleep seven days a week. It’s pretty intense, but I think the mission isn’t over yet, and we still got a long way ago before we can really make a dent in the world on accelerating the advent of sustainable energy."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 188, "phrase": "I mean, the goal Tesla, from beginning, has been to accelerate sustainable energy, but if you say like what percentage of cars on the road are electric today, it’s still very, very tiny, like an order of 1%, or less than 1% of the total fleet worldwide. So that’s the full have long way to go for on the order of 1% of the fleet is electric. There’s also a tremendous way to go on solar power, although it’s exciting to see the advent of very cost-competitive wind and solar and geothermal. Of course, we need a large volume of stationary battery packs. I mean basically, maybe the three legs of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, led by solar, wind, geothermal and hydro and a few others. I’m actually not against nuclear fission. I actually think nuclear fission is, with a well-designed reactor in a situation that is not subject to bad weather or seriously bad weather is actually is a good thing to do."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 190, "phrase": "Then the second thing you need is stationary storage need batteries because most renewable energy is intermittent. The wind doesn’t blow all the time. The sun doesn’t shine all the time, so you need a lot of batteries, and it needs to be very long-lasting and high cycle life, and then you need electric transport. If you have those three things, we’ve got a very bright future with respect to energy and the environment. So a long way to go on that, and so I’m still very much fired up to work on that."}, {"author": "Speaker 6", "serial_number": 192, "phrase": "Fantastic. And let’s take the last question please."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 194, "phrase": "Thank you. Our last question will come from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Gene Munster", "serial_number": 196, "phrase": "I was happy to see the update on the timing of Semi and had a couple of related questions. And first, since Semi Trucks typically travel predictable highway miles, will Tesla Semi may be the first to achieve full autonomy?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 198, "phrase": "I think that’s quite likely, yes. Yes, I can’t imagine … I’m not sure who would be number two, but yes, it seems highly likely, yes."}, {"author": "Gene Munster", "serial_number": 200, "phrase": "Okay. And then my-"}, {"author": "Jerome", "serial_number": 202, "phrase": "The hardware, it’s the exact same part numbers on the Semi on the Tesla cars. There’s no difference."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 204, "phrase": "Yeah. That’s true. Yeah. As it is, we need to modify the parameters. Software parameters change for autopilot or self-driving because it needs now to Model 3, Model Y, Model X or Model S. We just need to inform the vehicle, inform the full self-driving brain that it is now in a Semi Truck."}, {"author": "Gene Munster", "serial_number": 206, "phrase": "Would it need to be retrained then as part of that?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 208, "phrase": "No. I think there will be … You have a different control functions because there are turns that you could do in a regular car that you cannot do in a Semi, like you do want to try to parallel park this thing on the street in a city. It needs to know its limitations being a giant truck."}, {"author": "Gene Munster", "serial_number": 210, "phrase": "Makes sense. My follow-up question was related to if you could just help us explain why battery electric will win versus hydrogen cell fuel tech?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 212, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, honestly, I’ve had this question a million times for just for regular vehicles, even back in the early Roadster days, even before we had the Roadster out. People were saying that somehow hydrogen is going to be a better means of energy storage in a car than batteries, and it was like this is just really not the case. Hydrogen is a very … It’s number one in the periodic table. It’s got very low density. It’s got low density as a liquid, like styrofoam-level density as a liquid. And then it’s only a liquid very close to absolute zero, so you have to have a … It’s really not realistic to keep it as liquid. You want to have it as a high-pressure gas that has even lower density, so you need a gigantic fuel tank volumetrically, and it’s got to be very high pressure. It’s a big pain in the ass, basically."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 214, "phrase": "If somebody is going to, say, use an ultimate chemical energy storage mechanism to hydrogen, I’d say just use propane or something like that or methane. Those will be way better than hydrogen. And then having it be a fuel cell just adds even further complications to the situation. It’s just crazy basically. And we’re extremely confident that we could a long-range trucking with batteries. The math works out. If you could just take, say, watt-hours per kilogram of currently available cells, and say, “Okay, what weight would you need to go, let’s say, 500 miles, and to what degree does that affect your payload?” It’s like, “Okay, if you do it right, you basically have no effect on your payload or almost nothing, and you can have a long-range truck.” I mean, Jerome, do you want to add to that?"}, {"author": "Jerome", "serial_number": 216, "phrase": "Well, I agree with everything, and we see also an increase on the regionalization of trucks, and I think it will be perfect. The Tesla Semi will be perfect for it, yes. I’m looking forward to having some additional ones on the road very soon."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 218, "phrase": "But basically, we do not see any issues with creating a compelling long-range truck with batteries. Apart from cell supply. Cell supply is the only thing. Cell supply’s it."}, {"author": "Jerome", "serial_number": 220, "phrase": "I think it’s going to be awesome."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 222, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Speaker 6", "serial_number": 224, "phrase": "All right. Thank you very much. And unfortunately, that’s all the time we have today, so thanks for all of your great questions, and we will speak to you again in about three months. Thank you. Thanks, Elon."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 226, "phrase": "Thanks.

I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 1:00 PM Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please press star one now if you would like to join the question queue. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 4, "phrase": "Thanks, Martin. All right, so Q3 was our best quarter in history. We achieved the record production deliveries, record revenue, record net income; both GAAP and non-GAAP and record free cash flow of $1.4 billion. This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team. I could not be more proud to work with such a great group of people. Just really kick-ass performance throughout the world. Of course, we had our Battery Day. So we hosted, showed our plans for how we can expand in the future and improve core battery technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistry level and I think more significantly at the manufacturing technology level. There’s a comment I made in the past is that I think Tesla’s long-term competitive strength will be primarily manufacturing. This is counterintuitive, but I’m quite confident this will be what happens."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 6, "phrase": "All right. So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries. We wanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch. First, wishful thinking, just look at it from the fundamental physics and say rather than compare to other products in the market, just say from a physics standpoint, what’s the limit of physics? What’s the platonic idea of the perfect cell and how close can we get there? And that was our aspiration. I think we’ve got a pretty good approach to it, which will have to get better over time. And we went through all of the engineering solutions for every important part of battery design and production, and we’ll continue to iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology. The result, we think, in a few years will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capital expenditures required are a-third or less of what they are today, and we expect Giga Berlin will see our first battery cell production line at scale."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 8, "phrase": "Regarding the full self-driving beta release, the Autopilot team, again, just a really all-star team. I spent a lot of time with the Autopilot team. And there’s a lot of really talented people in that team who’ve worked incredibly hard to get the beta release out, so I’d just really like to thank them for their hard work. And it’s just a very smart group of people. So I think we’re starting very slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place, and so we put it out there last night, and then we’ll see how it goes and then probably release it to more people this weekend or early next week, and then just gradually step it up until we have, hopefully, a wide release by the end of this year. And of course, as the system collects more data and it becomes more robust."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 10, "phrase": "So it’s sort of like how does Google as a search engine get better? It’s because everyone is programming it by asking questions all the time and clicking on particular links, so it’s got this great feedback and that makes it an extremely effective search engine. It’s the same thing for autonomy, having on the order of a million cars that are providing feedback and specifically feedback on strange corner case situations that you just can’t even come up with in simulation. This is the thing that is really valuable. It’s not like the obvious stuff you can do in simulation, but weird corner cases. Only reality can give you that. But we’re able to say, “Okay, we need to train the system on this corner case situation and look for examples, so we can then try it against those examples and improve some very esoteric corner case.”"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 12, "phrase": "And it’s also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach. There is no need for high-definition maps or a cellphone connection, so the system is designed such that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you’re in a place that you have never been to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like a person. That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 14, "phrase": "Then in terms of capacity build out. We’re making progress on the three major factories. We’re continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well at Tesla China team. It is just, I mean, incredibly good. Super smart, work hard. It’s like I’m always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes. It’s beyond all reasonable expectations. And then we’re under construction in Berlin and Texas and Austin, so we’re also making good progress there. Yeah. Good. It’s overall going well. I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin, we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year, but because of the exponential nature of the spool up of a manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it will start off very slow at first and then afterward will become very large."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 16, "phrase": "Just in general, manufacturing follows the S-curve, and I think sometimes people, if they haven’t spent a lot of time manufacturing, kind of think that once you have a factory, you can just sort of turn it on and it’s at capacity. But it will typically take about 12 to 18 months to reach capacity, and that is a very fast period of time, especially for new technology. So yes, I’d say, 12 to 24 months even. So generally, what I see is the manufacturing capacity is underestimated in the beginning for quite some time, then it is sometimes overestimated because this is an s-curve. It goes exponential to linear to logarithmic, and it’s actually an incredibly hard thing, just bringing a production plant up to volume technology."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 18, "phrase": "If you can actually think of it like you’ve got to first order approximation, 10,000 unique parts of processes, all of which operate on an s- curve and with a bunch of uncertainty, and you can just slide 10,000 s-curves on an x-axis, and that’s what’s bringing up a large automotive plant is like. Which one is the laggard? Which one is the leader? It’s very difficult to tell, and it’s constantly changing, so it’s really one of the most difficult challenges I’ve ever seen. So let’s see. In conclusion, thank you. What we would achieve would not be possible without the incredible hard work of the tens of thousands of Tesla employees and all people and our suppliers as well. I’d like to thank our suppliers. We continue to grow as fast as we can while focusing on cost control and improving quality, and ultimately the best company will be that which makes great products at an affordable price, and that’s our goal. I think I’ve never felt more optimistic about the future of Tesla than I do today. I’d also like to thank investors who have stuck with us through thick and thin. I think there’s a lot more good stuff to come. All right. With that, we can move to questions."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 20, "phrase": "Thank you, Elon. I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some opening remarks as well."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 22, "phrase": "Okay. Sure."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 24, "phrase": "Yeah. Thanks, Martin. Overall, our financial health continues to rapidly improve with Q3 being another great quarter on nearly all dimensions, as Elon has mentioned. On net income, we achieved our fifth sequential quarter of profitability, our best net income, and nearly double-digit operating margins. Two things that are important to note to set context for Q3 profitability: First, the regulatory credits business was stronger than our expectations, and we are tracking to more than double this year compared to last. Second, as a result in the rise of the market cap of the company, the second and third tranche of the CEO grant vested during the quarter. Additionally, we have begun expensing one more tranche, resulting in roughly $300 million of combined period expense. I think it’s reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the health of the core business."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 26, "phrase": "On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to 23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin. Keep in mind that inefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2. We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs. We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased from under 50% at the beginning of last year to over 70% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy. We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet. Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations. In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow. Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we’re continuing to make progress on that front."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 28, "phrase": "On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet. Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital, as we’ve made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available. Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations. Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin. As for previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we’re expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 30, "phrase": "Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund. This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future. While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont. Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $5 billion equity raise in September. Note that we’re currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 32, "phrase": "Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business. We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle. We’ve made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half. We’re also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year. While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it’s possible with tight execution across the company. So congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year. I’ll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our energy business for a few comments."}, {"author": "RJ Johnson", "serial_number": 34, "phrase": "Thank you, Zach. First, I’d like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done. Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we’re poised for continued strong growth in Energy storage and solar. Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business, and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity. We have more demand than supply through 2021, and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedented demand across the globe through 2023 and beyond. Our order book is rapidly filling up through 2023 in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale. Large scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation in many locations across the globe. This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will further displace existing and new fossil fuel generation. This is true for standalone storage as well."}, {"author": "RJ Johnson", "serial_number": 36, "phrase": "Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware and software with advanced real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market where deployed. For PowerWall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage, as customers seek increased reliability and backup home generation. We have a very large backlog of PowerWall orders and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer orders. We’re just now capturing the full power of customer-cited solar plus storage, as customers in some jurisdictions are providing services back to the grid when they don’t need to consume energy or have backup power. This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally. In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit …"}, {"author": "RJ Johnson", "serial_number": 38, "phrase": "In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $1.49 a watt after tax incentives, which is the lowest in the industry. We’re able to do this by leveraging our online vehicle ordering infrastructure, which substantially reduced the soft cost associated with sales and marketing. As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased profitability in the retrofit business. We’re using the same methodology across the entire energy business, including service to capitalize on the technology backbone of the company."}, {"author": "RJ Johnson", "serial_number": 40, "phrase": "Solar Roof is especially exciting as we’ve gained significant experience over the last year in the installation process, which is a key enabler to scale the business. We’ve recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day. Please note, it still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof installation. Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors. Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience and will enable the business to grow exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency. In closing, we believe the energy segment is poised for strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale, while reducing cost to maximize profitability. I want to thank the team again for their hard work and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 42, "phrase": "Thank you very much, everyone. And let’s begin with questions from say.com. The first question from retail shareholders is is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the same time as vehicle production? Can Tesla share more information on what products you’ll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 44, "phrase": "Yeah. Drew, do you want to take that?"}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 46, "phrase": "Sure. Yeah, we will incorporate 4680 design solutions into many applications in time across both energy and vehicle and we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the new factory in Berlin as it ramps."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 48, "phrase": "Thank you very much. Let’s go to the next question, which is question number two from retail shareholders. Does Tesla’s tablet cell design allow for significantly higher peak charging rates? Does it improve the required taper curve?"}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 50, "phrase": "Yeah. The fundamental limitation on charge rate in lithium-ion batteries is avoiding lithium plating on the anode. And while the tablet’s architecture helps avoid overheating because it’s a more power dense architecture at high continuous charge rates, it doesn’t change the anode plating story. Electro design and anode material choice more directly determines the maximum charge rate and how to avoid that lithium plating problem."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 52, "phrase": "Okay. Thank you very much. The third question from retail is, would FSD be able to be transferred to our next vehicle or pay a transfer fee? It would add to a brand loyalty, the same way gaming companies and cellphone companies keep you in their ecosystem by letting you transfer purchases to upgraded hardware."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 54, "phrase": "I think we’ll give it to both."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 56, "phrase": "Okay. The fourth question is what are the remaining constraints to be solved for Solar Roof installations to ramp significantly? Carl?"}, {"author": "Carl Peterson", "serial_number": 58, "phrase": "Yes. I am Carl Peterson. I’m on the Solar Roof Engineering and Installation. The biggest constraint right now in Solar Roof ramp is getting enough installers on board and trained and experienced. We’ve made a lot of progress on this in Q3, and we’re continuing to hire. The next opportunity is improving the material flow on the job site. We’ve talked about this a lot in the factory as well, that setting up the right packaging, kitting so that every installer on the roof has the parts they need at their fingertips. Also, we’ve had great response from third-party roofing contractors as they’re ramping up installations for Solar Roof on their customer homes, which is a big source of future growth."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 60, "phrase": "Thank you, Carl."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 62, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, here’s the way to think about a product, in my opinion. You have to say, I think, what do you want the world to look like? When you look around the neighborhood in future a decade from now, what do you want? What products are going to make your life better? What future do you want? And I think a future where we’ve got beautiful roofs with generating energy that are tough and resilient and better in every way than a regular roof and a lab with energy, that’s the future we want. The Solar Roof is a killer product. This will become obvious next year."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 64, "phrase": "Thank you. And the last question from retail shareholders is, you recently referred to Tesla as a conglomerate of start-ups. Other than manufacturing electric cars, what do you suppose will be the most valuable business units within Tesla over the next five to seven years? Could you envision any of them ever spinning out from Tesla?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 66, "phrase": "Well, as I think about this today. Tesla has probably … There’s probably in excess of a dozen startups effectively in Tesla. Every major product line is a start-up. Every big new plant is a start-up and sometimes, frankly, we have to learn a lesson a few times before it sinks in. Even things like service and sales are startups. Other car companies, OEMs, they don’t own their sales and service, so we have to create our service network. We have to create our sales and delivery network. We have to do this in, I don’t know, 40 countries, multiple languages. So many people don’t really even know much about is our internal applications team that writes the core technology that runs the company."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 68, "phrase": "We are not dependent on enterprise software. For those who understand what this means, this is a very big deal. And my hat’s off to the great work of the internal applications team. They are like the nervous system, the operating system of the Company, the Tesla operating system, extremely fundamental. Obviously, insurance is substantial. So insurance could very well be 30%, 40% of the value of the car business, frankly. And as we’ve talked about before, with a much better feedback group, instead of being statistical, it can be specific. And obviously, somebody does not have to choose our insurance, but I think a lot of people will. It’s going to cost less and be better. So why wouldn’t you?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 70, "phrase": "And the whole autonomy thing is a start-up. Designing our computer chips was a start-up. Obviously, cells are a start up. Designing and making our own power electronics for the drive unit, design, manufacturing our own motors, chargers, the Supercharger network is a start-up. I think that people just don’t really understand about Tesla is that it’s a whole chain of startups and like, “Well, you didn’t do that before.” Yeah, but we’re doing it now. I mean, I think so far, we’ve maybe been a bit slow with some of the start-ups, but I don’t think we’ve had any of them fail. So, so far so good. No plans to spin anything out. That just sounds like added complexity."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 72, "phrase": "Thank you very much. Let’s go through institutional investor questions. The question number one is as a bridge to the ride-hailing network, could you leverage the insurance product to give customers the ability to rent out their vehicles via the app, thereby enabling the car to make money for them, so basically proprietary version of Toro."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 74, "phrase": "We think we’re focused on enabling the robotaxi system. So you can just basically … That’s really quite a small subset of the overall robotaxi or robocar thing where you can have the car get autonomous for you. You can have the car be you have to share with friends and family. You can add or remove it from the network. You can have it be entirely in the network. I mean, if you’re an Uber or Lyft driver, you could be managing a fleet of 10 cars. This sort of seems like a shepherd tending the flock type of thing. It’s like you just get way more leverage. So I think we could do that. It wouldn’t be very difficult, but we’re going to just be focused on just having an autonomous network. That has sort of elements of Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. Yeah."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 76, "phrase": "Thank you. And the second question from institutionals is residential energy use accounts for roughly the same magnitude of carbon emissions as road transport. Today’s boilers and air con units are profoundly unsexy. Could you elaborate on HVAC advances with the Y? Could also find use in a domestic system?"}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 78, "phrase": "Yes."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 80, "phrase": "Yeah, go ahead, Drew."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 82, "phrase": "I was just going to say, I mean, I think one of the things we focused on with the Model Y and now Model 3 pump system was learning how to build a tightly integrated system capable of moving heat to and from anywhere really, powertrain battery, cabin, the environment, in outside ambient temperatures all the way down to like negative 20 C, so 30 C, and that’s definitely applicable to the home needs of heating and cooling the home and the water in your house, so certainly applicable. Elon?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 84, "phrase": "Yeah, absolutely. I think for heat pump in the car, being able to use the batteries, both as a thermal and an electric energy reservoir is very significant. Same thing could be applied to a home with the water heater and the battery pack itself, of course. So I think there’s potential for an integrated home system that kind of does power generation storage, heating, cooling, air filtration, water purification in a really tight package. We don’t actually have a prototype or anything, but I think conceptually, that is something that would be probably good to have."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 86, "phrase": "Thank you. The third question from institutionals is if meeting your long-term volume targets requires price reductions that preclude you from achieving your low double-digit stated margin targets for the autos business, will you still reduce prices accordingly?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 88, "phrase": "Well, we want to make our cars more affordable, and it’s really important to separate out affordability from value for money. If the car is too expensive or any given product is too expensive and people don’t have enough money in the bank account, they simply can’t buy it no matter what the value proposition is. So it is important to lower the prices in order to such that people can literally just have enough money to buy it. I do not think we lack for a desire for our product, but we do lack for affordability, and so we have to improve the affordability of our products, so they are not out of reach of people. We want to bring them more in reach over time, but also improve our cost of production. Obviously, we get, hopefully, a little bit better every year. Sometimes a lot better, and in terms of margins, all of these margins are going to look pretty comically small when you factor in autonomy."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 90, "phrase": "Yeah. Two things I’ll add to that. Without a doubt, we’re moving forward to push as much volume as we reasonably can. So Elon talked to earlier kind of how the S-curve and the time line incremental factories looks like, and so we’re moving full speed ahead with as much volume as we can reasonably move forward with."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 92, "phrase": "The second comment I’d make is, if you just look at the journey of the company over the last year and a half we have grown volumes and grown gross margins despite a number of price reductions over that period of time, and we have cut OpEx fairly stable during that period of time as well, and so the key is what Elon mentioned here. I mean, we have to improve the affordability of the vehicle. We have to also continue to make progress improving the cost structure of not only COGS, but of OpEx, which we’ve demonstrated over the last year and a half, I think, quite successfully and improve the value of the vehicles at the same time. So in addition to reducing the cost of the car, we’re making the cars better, and that’s the formula to sell the volume. That’s what we’re focused on."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 94, "phrase": "Thank you very much. The fourth question from institutionals is at what point do you expect to have enough internal or external battery capacity to start ramping up stationary storage deployments again?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 96, "phrase": "Yes. We’re ramping up stationary storage a lot. So I mean, it’s approximately doubling. We expect it to approximately double next year, so that’s pretty good, and hopefully we can accelerate that in years to come."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 98, "phrase": "And approximately doubling it this year, too. So the growth is-"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 100, "phrase": "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, if you just keep doubling things, pretty soon, you hit the mass of the universe, and we’ll need to start turning Jupiter into cells."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 102, "phrase": "And the last question from institutionals is manufacturing is hard. Delays happen. What contingencies do you have in place to ensure the bottlenecks that you might encounter while renting internal cell production will not preclude you from your ability to hit your Model Y production volume targets in Berlin and Texas?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 104, "phrase": "Yeah. So I think we’re trying to de-risk to 2021 so that there’s almost no dependency on our internal cell production. It’s very, very small."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 106, "phrase": "… production. It’s very, very small. The internal cell production will help us ramp in ’22, but we’re not dependent on it for ’21."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 108, "phrase": "And to de-risk the manufacturing system itself, that was one of the reasons why we located our pilot production facility here in Fremont, so we can rapidly iterate on manufacturing scale-up challenges, provide rapid feedback to the design of both the product and the equipment."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 110, "phrase": "Yeah, and our pilot line is pretty big as pilot lines go. It will be in the top 10 cell factories on Earth, I believe."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 112, "phrase": "Yeah. That’s true."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 114, "phrase": "Subscale one. Yeah, so …"}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 116, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And now we can go to questions from analysts online. Sherry?"}, {"author": "Sherry", "serial_number": 118, "phrase": "Thank you. Again, we remind you to please ask one question and one followup question. Our first question will come from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Rod Lache", "serial_number": 120, "phrase": "Hi, everybody. Just wanted to ask about the targets from your Battery Day. Looked like you could be approaching something like 20 million vehicles by 2030 if you hit those goals. Could you maybe share with us a little bit more of a midterm target, like where would you be by 2025? And maybe give us a little bit more insight into the investment required to get there, just to put that extra $2 billion to $2.5 billion per year into context."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 122, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through the next financial is that if things are doubling every year or even just growing 50%, then if you shift plus/minus one year, it has a huge effect on the number.It sounds like, wow, you either massively exceeded or massively undershot, but it’s actually, what’s going on is a giant S-curve. So a whole bunch of pretty big S-curves that integrate into a gigantic S-curve, so that’s why it’s difficult to predict the middle. And I’m not saying for sure we’ll hit 20 million vehicles, but it does seem like a good goal to have because that would mean that we’re replacing 1% of the global fleet per year."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 124, "phrase": "And it’s difficult to say that we’re … Are we really changing the world if we’re not switching out 1% of the global fossil fuel vehicles? I mean, I’m not sure that we can make that argument unless we change at least 1% of the vehicles per year. So that’s where the 20 million vehicle per year comes from. It’s like 1% of two billion vehicles, which is the global fleet currently. The global fleet is growing, so probably will be a bit bigger in the future. So it’s hard to say. It’s like map an S-curve to a 20 million vehicle target in 2030 and move a slider around and see what that number looks like. That will give you about as much insight as we have."}, {"author": "Rod Lache", "serial_number": 126, "phrase": "Okay. And just secondly, if solid-state lithium metal were to become viable, could you just maybe just pass along your perspective on that, and would you be able to repurpose most of what you’re putting into place for changes in technology?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 128, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean answering the first part, the cell production system is fairly agnostic on anode, cathode, electrolyte, separator, that kind of thing. We could change, and we will change and upgrade all aspects of the cell. And we could, for example, make ion phosphate or nickel manganese or something like that. It’s quite adaptable. So I wouldn’t say just too much more about it. The lithium, like a pure lithium anode it’s not as great as it may sound. Yeah, volumetrically, you’re not gaining all that much because if you got nothing, let’s say on the anode side, and you just play out lithium, it’s got to go somewhere, so you’ve got to have room for it."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 130, "phrase": "Yeah. Lithium is less volumetrically dense in the pure metal form than it is intercalated into silicon, so it’s kind of hard to understand, but that’s the truth. And then, as we showed in our presentation, the total anode cost that we’re talking about is only $1 or $2 per kilowatt hour, so the value of like removing the anode material isn’t super high either. So yes, I totally agree, Elon."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 132, "phrase": "Yeah, exactly. But if it should turn out that a pure lithium anode is the right move, that would be no problem."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 134, "phrase": "Right. Agreed."}, {"author": "Rod Lache", "serial_number": 136, "phrase": "All right. Thank you."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 138, "phrase": "Thank you. Next question, please?"}, {"author": "Sherry", "serial_number": 140, "phrase": "Our next question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Colin Rusch", "serial_number": 142, "phrase": "Thanks so much, guys. Yeah, you’re talking about in-sourcing a number of processes. Can you talk a little bit about which processes you’re moving in-house and the equipment that you’re planning to make yourself versus some of the equipment that you’d be buying from other folks?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 144, "phrase": "Sorry. Are you talking about for cell manufacturing or something, or-"}, {"author": "Colin Rusch", "serial_number": 146, "phrase": "Well, cell manufacturing for sure, as well on the molds that you talked about, in terms of the CapEx budget that you mentioned earlier, talking about the number of processes coming in-house and which equipment pieces you’re planning to make yourself versus buying?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 148, "phrase": "Okay. Well, I mean, Tesla is absurdly vertically integrated compared to other auto companies or basically most any company. We have a massive amount of internal manufacturing technology that we build ourselves. We literally make the machine. In fact, we design, so like, okay, what are the things we want to make, design a machine that will make that thing, then we make the machine. This makes it quite difficult to copy Tesla, which we’re not actually all that opposed to people copying us, but it’s quite difficult because you can’t do catalog engineering. You can’t just, “I’ll pick up the supplier catalog. I’ll get one of this machines, one of that machine. Bingo, I’m now Tesla.” There is no catalog. What catalog? So we made the machine that made the machine that made the machine."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 150, "phrase": "Now, we don’t want to get carried away here, and quite frankly, we would like to outsource less. That would be great, because then if we could outsource … If we take something that we’re doing and outsource it, then we could take those people, and we’re going to have them do something else. But yeah, it’s like we’re just making a crazy amount of machinery internally. Tesla is not well understood. If you just walk around the factory, you’d just get a sense for it. And, yeah, I don’t know if this is like a smart move, But I just know, hey, if we’re trying to make progress and nobody’s got the machines that we need, we’ve got to make it, so we do."}, {"author": "Colin Rusch", "serial_number": 152, "phrase": "Okay. And then the second question is really around the balance sheet has really changed. You guys have run awfully lean, and you’ve got a lot more cushion at this point, and obviously, there’s opportunities around insurance to drive out some of the cost of ownership as well as financials. How are you guys thinking about that as you move into trying to accelerate demand a little bit and your ability to leverage your access to capital and enable some of those other products? Is that changing from where you’ve been in the past?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 154, "phrase": "Yes. I mean, something like insurance is a good example of a product that’s basically made by our internal applications team. So we made the insurance product and connect it to the car, look at the data, calculate the risk. This is all basically internal software application. It’s pretty low capital but has very high return. I don’t know. We’re trying to spend money at the fastest rate that we can possibly spend it and not waste it. That’s our current plan, and so it’s quite hard to spend money without wasting it. We’re really just trying to not waste too much of it, frankly. We will certainly waste some of it, but trying to not to waste too much of it. This is very difficult. But otherwise, we just try to spend money as quickly as possible in a way that is sensible and yields more value than it costs."}, {"author": "Sherry", "serial_number": 156, "phrase": "Thank you. Our next question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Morgan Stanley", "serial_number": 158, "phrase": "Hey, Elon. A question on LIDAR. If LIDAR were totally free, would you want to use it in your cars near term? Would that tech significantly help Tesla on the training of your neural network for FSD?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 160, "phrase": "I mean, totally free, probably not. I think even if it was free, we wouldn’t put it on."}, {"author": "Morgan Stanley", "serial_number": 162, "phrase": "Okay. Let’s follow up then. Amazon appears to be investing and building an autonomous or electric transport network of some ilk through some organic investments, but also Zoox, Aurora, Rivian, etc. What advice would you give Jeff Bezos in his endeavor?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 164, "phrase": "Well, I don’t know how much he cares about this, but I guess, he sure is investing a lot of money in it. I mean, I think you obviously, if you care about autonomy, you need to focus on vision because the entire road system is based on passive optical, so you have to solve passive optical to have a self-driving system that is a generalized solution. And once you solve passive optical, you’ve solved self-driving, so why bother with anything else?"}, {"author": "Morgan Stanley", "serial_number": 166, "phrase": "Thanks, Elon."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 168, "phrase": "Welcome."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 170, "phrase": "Thank you. Go to our next question, please."}, {"author": "Sherry", "serial_number": 172, "phrase": "Our next question will come from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Pierre Ferragu", "serial_number": 174, "phrase": "Hey. Thanks a lot for taking my question. A very simple one. You haven’t talked that much about like the Cybertruck today, and I was wondering how like the ramp of that product is looking like, when we should see the product hitting the road, and how fast do you expect to ramp volumes? Then I have a quick follow-up."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 176, "phrase": "Sure. I was in the studio actually last Friday with Franz and the team just going over just sort of some improvements to the Cybertruck. Generally, at Tesla, we really aim to make the car that is delivered better than the car that is unveiled, because it always drove me crazy. Car companies would unveil these awesome looking cars, and you’re like, “Great. Can’t wait until they make that,” and then the car they actual make is much worse, and it’s really disappointing? So, man, we always want to make the car that we deliver be better than the car we unveil, and that’s the goal with the Cybertruck. So there’s a lot of small improvements compared to what was unveiled. I think it’s going to be better than what we showed and yeah, it’s cool."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 178, "phrase": "It’s going to be made in Austin, so dependent on completing that factory, and there are obviously new technologies with the high hardness kind of armored exoskeleton. It’s never been done before, so there’ll probably be some challenges along the way. And obviously, something that’s extremely high hardness and difficult to scratch or dent is also difficult to form, so there’s manufacturing challenges there. That’s why it’s so cleaner, although it also looks good, I think, from a cleaner standpoint. Yeah, if all goes well, we’ll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries toward the end of next year. Yeah, so it’s difficult to predict. I’d say there’s probably a lot of deliveries in ’22 and some deliveries toward the end of next year if things go well."}, {"author": "Pierre Ferragu", "serial_number": 180, "phrase": "Okay. And now I’m trying to get a sense of how next year is going to look like. So if I look at your production capacity at the end of this year, it’s going to be almost 850,000 units on an annualized basis, and you’re going to increase capacity in Shanghai, open Berlin. You say today you would open Austin as well, so you’re probably going to end the year above one million units. And so am I right thinking next year we should expect to deliver somewhere between 840,000 and one million cars during the year?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 182, "phrase": "Yes. Go ahead, Zach."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 184, "phrase": "Yeah, we’ll provide guidance on 2021 after next earnings call."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 186, "phrase": "I mean, it’s in that vicinity. Yeah.. You’re not far off."}, {"author": "Pierre Ferragu", "serial_number": 188, "phrase": "Thank you."}, {"author": "Sherry", "serial_number": 190, "phrase": "Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Dan Levy", "serial_number": 192, "phrase": "Hi. Good evening. Thank you. Just wanted to start with a question on the quarter. Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to Fremont Model 3? And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter, was this just purely a function of higher volume? Or was there also FSD revenues? Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter."}, {"author": "Zach", "serial_number": 194, "phrase": "Sure. On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release. It’s not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter. With respect to product margins, what we’re seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product. Shanghai continues to make good progress there. Model Y cost is also coming down quite quickly as we ramp that, but we’ve guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model 3 built in Fremont costs. It’s not quite there, and it’s also a bit of a moving target. As Model 3 Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that. But we’re generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin, strength in Model Y margins, and not too far off of this, we’re seeing strength in Model 3 Fremont, S and X margins. So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite a good story for the products."}, {"author": "Dan Levy", "serial_number": 196, "phrase": "Great. Great."}, {"author": "Jerome", "serial_number": 198, "phrase": "Story for the products."}, {"author": "Speaker 6", "serial_number": 200, "phrase": "Great. Thanks. And then this is a follow-up. Wanted to ask about your strategy in Europe and I think your strategy generally has been you cut costs and that allows you to cut price and you can generate the extra volume and I think that’s we’re seeing in China and the use of LSP, that’s a good example."}, {"author": "Speaker 6", "serial_number": 202, "phrase": "So once you ramp in Berlin, what’s a reasonable expectation of what pricing might look like in Europe and how flexible are you going to be on pricing to generate incremental red credit so, a margin is out of the gate that are a little low, but that are then used for the red credits that help to offset that."}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 204, "phrase": "Yeah. But what I think I would say generally to the question is, I mean, we’ve been in a position for some time now where we are prioritizing where in the world we send our productions and there’s different factors to that, depending upon when different product changes are made, what the logistics reading looks like, different things going on in different markets, but we are in a position where we need to prioritize."}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 206, "phrase": "I mean, what we’re trying to do as fast as we possibly can, is get production up higher, so that we’re not in a position of needing to prioritize again. Yeah, I think that gets at the sentiment of your question."}, {"author": "Speaker 7", "serial_number": 208, "phrase": "Okay, let’s go to the next question, please."}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 210, "phrase": "Our next question will come from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Gene", "serial_number": 212, "phrase": "Did you mean a question on the Semi, and if you could just walk us through the development of mega chargers, platooning, and maybe just how you think about autonomy for Tesla Semi and how you envision it impacting the broader trucking industry beyond just EV."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 214, "phrase": "Oh, well actually Jerome, do you want to answer that?"}, {"author": "Jerome", "serial_number": 216, "phrase": "Yeah, we continue the development of the semi and in particular mega chargers. We realized that a 350 kilowatt or so that we might be looking for cars is not going to be enough for Semi. So we’re looking for something much more powerful than that, that can achieve essentially charging as fast, the Semi as you during the break, during your driving time so that you can drive until the next break."}, {"author": "Jerome", "serial_number": 218, "phrase": "So there is no usable or efficient time wasted for charging the Semi, that’s the goal. We’re working with other parties to make sure that there is a standard infrastructure that will be able to be deployed for all customers. Probably all I can say at this point, yeah. [crosstalk 00:03:07]."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 220, "phrase": "Sorry, go ahead."}, {"author": "Jerome", "serial_number": 222, "phrase": "And just, we’re not working in isolation. Yeah. We’re trying to… We have to invent it because it doesn’t exist, but we’re trying to invent something that could be helpful for everybody."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 224, "phrase": "Yeah, just a note on the sort of Semi. The Semi does consume a lot of cells. So it’s a ‘four to six times’ more than a passenger vehicle. [inaudible 00:00:51:34]. Five-ish times. So if we are cell constrained, it’s simple to ramp up the Semi because there’s no cells."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 226, "phrase": "So we need to solve the cell constraint before ramping Semi to a significant volume. That’s the only real constraint on Semi progress. And we found over and over again, we just kept running into cell production limitations, and then we’re just taking things out of one pocket and putting them in another. So we just need more cells so that we can do more stationary storage, more vehicles, more vehicle lines [inaudible 00:04:17], we need more cells."}, {"author": "Gene", "serial_number": 228, "phrase": "That makes sense. A question, just, if you think about, you’ve talked about Robotaxi, and how you think that’s going to impact kind of humans moving around. How do you think about Semi impacting freight longer term? I mean, is this something that is nice to have and a compliment to all of your tech in a new market, or do you think that this could be a material business?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 230, "phrase": "I think it’s a very material for sure. Really long term, all transported will go autonomous. Yeah. Horses are already autonomous, but all transport will go autonomous. Yeah, so including Semi. So it’ll be pretty significant."}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 232, "phrase": "The technology that we’re putting in Semi is identical to what we’re putting in the other vehicles."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 234, "phrase": "Yeah. Just bigger and more motors."}, {"author": "Speaker 7", "serial_number": 236, "phrase": "Yeah. Thank you. Let’s go to the-"}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 238, "phrase": "Our next question will come from Ben Keller with Baird. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Ben", "serial_number": 240, "phrase": "Hey, thanks for taking my question. Hey, Elon, what do you think the biggest structural issue is with the let’s call it old school [inaudible 00:53:41] or one or two of the structural issues for them not getting their act together and catching it up with you? And then you mentioned what we want the world to look like ahead of us. What do you envision that is like? Just Tesla or Tesla and Rivian, or what? Thanks."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 242, "phrase": "Well, I do think there will be other car companies. I don’t think we’re going to be the only one. So I mean, the thing is that, what other car companies do even in the auto segment is quite a small subset of what Tesla does. So Tesla, we design and build [inaudible 00:06: 31]. So we’re designing and building so much more of the car than other OEMs."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 244, "phrase": "We will largely go to the traditional supply base and that core catalog engineering. So it’s not very adventurous and it basically ends up like all the products end up looking the same because they’re going to the same suppliers."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 246, "phrase": "So to agree that you inherit legacy components, you inherit the legacy limitations and car structure and so you kind of need to make new ingredients, new parts, and then you need… Then there’s no machine to make those parts, so you have to make the machine that makes the parts."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 248, "phrase": "Tesla is like, we probably… I mean, we might be in order of magnitude, more vertically integrated than other car companies and which we’re not now, we certainly will be. And then we also have to create our sales and service and distribution system and I don’t know, something on the report 40 countries. Somewhere, it will be over a hundred countries. Whereas the other car companies do not own their sales in service and distribution."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 250, "phrase": "So, they have a case that they kind of assemble parts from a supply base and then hand them to a dealer base. So it’s like comparing Tesla to other car companies, like just comparing just really one facet or dimension of Tesla. We’re like maybe 10% in common with other car companies?"}, {"author": "Speaker 7", "serial_number": 252, "phrase": "Thank you. Let’s go to the last question please."}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 254, "phrase": "And our final question today will come from Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Phillipe", "serial_number": 256, "phrase": "Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I’ve got two. The first one to me is trying to understand your business model for stationary storage, have your thoughts on it. I mean, there are two broad directions to me, one is selling hardware, which is a bit of a cost plus business. And I’m just wondering if there’s an opportunity where Tesla could actually share into the savings that utilities in particular could be able to achieve in like great stabilization. The information I was able to get on your business in Australia a few years ago, suggest that given the savings that are achieved, your hardware could have been sold at a higher price. I’m just wondering if you can share the views on where this is going."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 258, "phrase": "Yeah, I think you are probably right about that. I mean RJ and Zack, what do you guys think?"}, {"author": "RJ", "serial_number": 260, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, we’re already seeing this in Australia or we’re seeing behind the meter aggregation that is providing grid services back to the grid, which effectively reduces the price to the customer and reduces the prices for the grid operator. So you’re seeing this trend happening across the globe, and this is going to be at the residential level as well as the wholesale level. So your mega pack on one end and then power wall on the other side. These two working together in tandem and the software layer on top of it, ought to be better being that really is going to help make the grid more efficient using the hardware platform and software together."}, {"author": "Zack", "serial_number": 262, "phrase": "And just a point of clarification, the large battery power plant in Australia, we continue to operate that power plant and generate revenue in the market. So whether we could have sold it for more or less, we’re continuing to make money off of that power plant."}, {"author": "Phillipe", "serial_number": 264, "phrase": "Okay. Thank you. And the followup question I had was during the battery day, you talked about the cell’s vehicle integration approach. It’s very interesting and when I think about it, it looks like it means that the skateboard design that Tesla pioneered and many of your followers are using is going to become obsolete, or am I not thinking about it the right way?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 266, "phrase": "It will be obviously longterm, yes. I mean, several years from now, it’s not like existing cars stop having value. It’s just that if you have a structural pack where the pack is contributing a structural value to the car, because of the stuff like the composite honeycomb effect of get our share of transfer between an upper and lower plate, then anything that doesn’t do that it’s going to have to duplicate hardware."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 268, "phrase": "It’s going to weigh more, it’s going to cost more. And then the same goes for the front and rear castings. We’re trying to make the car like you would make a toy. If you had a toy model car then it’s got to be real cheap and look great. How would you make that? You would cast it. And that’s how it’s done."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 270, "phrase": "You would be absurd to make it up of tiny little pieces of stamp metal joined in complex ways. So it’s sort of a natural thing to do. And then the same goes for using the energy storage, the battery, as a structure, which is done for aircraft wings and for rockets. The early rockets and aircraft, they had a separate aeroshell from propellant tanks or fuel tanks, and then they realized that doesn’t make sense and you’ve got to have your fuel tank in wing shape, or you got to have your propellant tanks in the shape of the body of the rocket for example."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 272, "phrase": "You don’t want to put a box on a box, basically. Which over many years made it basically uncompetitive to have an aircraft that has separate fuel tanks from the wing. The wings need to be fuel tanks. But I wouldn’t think of this as like an overnight transition. It’s several years. But then, like I said, overtime, it just won’t be competitive to have a different architecture, in my opinion."}, {"author": "Speaker 7", "serial_number": 274, "phrase": "Thank you very much. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for the Q and A today. Appreciate all your great questions and we’ll speak to you again in about three months. Thank you. Goodbye."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 276, "phrase": "Thank you."}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 278, "phrase": "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call.

Since only 65% of shares were voted, we didn’t achieve the 66.67% necessary to overturn the current super majority bylaw."}, {"author": "James McRitchie", "serial_number": 40, "phrase": "It appears the proposal failed primarily for three reasons. One, the board put forth less than robust arguments in favor. Two, they added confusion with another proposal to reclassify the board, not into a single class, that’s the norm, but into two classes, elected in altering years. Third, the board also failed to make a substantial effort to solicit votes in favor. Also, please consider this proposal in context with other poor corporate governance provisions at Tesla. First, shareholders can only remove directors for cause. What that basically means is the director has to be caught in criminal activity for shareholders to remove them. Second, because the board is divided into three classes, shareholders can only hold individual directors accountable every three years. And third, shareholders cannot call special meetings, nor can they act by written consent. I hope you will agree. Corporations should not be democratic-free zones.

One, research shows that companies benefit from diverse and inclusive workplaces. Two, corporate policies that allow harassment and discrimination risk investors capital.

On this last issue, my organization brought the pending suit against Tesla for using cobalt mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo by young children. I personally met young boys who lost limbs or were paralyzed in cobalt tunnel collapses. Tesla sources cobalt from these very mines. And its claimed to have quote, “Zero tolerance for child labor,” in its supplier code of conduct is simply not true. Tesla is not only tolerating child labor in its cobalt supply chain, it is tolerating the death and maiming of young child minors."}, {"author": "Terry Collingsworth", "serial_number": 68, "phrase": "This demonstrates why the company must circle back and begin a process to report on its treatment of human rights issues as requested in this proposal.

At this time, I’d like to thank our stockholders for all of their active participation in today’s meeting and for those who just presented on the line. I’d also like to read some of the comments that have been submitted by you over the course of the meeting. The first comment comes from Michael [Overbaugh 00:01:02:01]. “I take great pride in the fact that we haven’t had to stoop to the level of what advertising represents to get where we are today. I’d hate to give into that kind of temptation now, when we’re so close to becoming a household name that’s based solely on our merit alone. But if assets do end up having to be set aside for marketing, I’d like to suggest that rather than shoving ads down the customer’s throat, we established some sort of hardcore nationwide campaign and event with the goal of getting as many people as possible behind the wheel of a Tesla for an introduction drive. It’s well-known how far just doing that alone goes to converting people into fans.”"}, {"author": "Al Prescott", "serial_number": 74, "phrase": "“A line I recently ran across says, ‘You can talk all about the specs as much as you want, but when it comes to buying a car, what ultimately puts butts in seats is the feeling that the vehicle gives you.’ By demonstrating that Tesla clearly has both the specs and the feeling, what more needs saying?”"}, {"author": "Al Prescott", "serial_number": 76, "phrase": "Our second comment comes from the United Steel workers on behalf of the Clean Air Now Coalition of Western New York by Sabrina Lu. And it reads as follows, “Proposal six and seven up for vote this year are the results of widespread concern about mistreatment of Tesla workers at US factories and across the supply chain. It is clear that Tesla is not interested in addressing the harm they have caused to their workers as their board is advising shareholders to vote against the proposal. We’re urging all shareholders to vote in favor of proposal six and seven. And on behalf of our workers at the United Steelworkers here in Western New York and for Tesla employees across the country and across the global supply chain, while this doesn’t repair the harm, that’s already been caused to countless employees, nor repair harm to children and communities forced into slave labor in the DRC, they represent steps towards a more just workplace at Tesla.”"}, {"author": "Al Prescott", "serial_number": 78, "phrase": "This concludes all of the comments. Thank you all for your participation in the comments. We’ll now have a final opportunity for any of you to submit proxies in order for them to be counted.

So based on the proxies that we have previously received, I’d like to announce on a preliminary basis that our stockholders have approved the recommendations of Tesla’s board on all agenda items, other than the stockholder proposal for an advisory vote regarding simple majority voting in our governing documents. After the final tabulation is completed, we’ll formally announce the results of the voting by filing a form 8-K with the SEC within four business days of today.

We’ve got the Tesla drive in movie theater, basically. It’s good to see everyone. It’s a little hard to read the room with everyone being in cars, but it’s the only way we can do it. So hopefully it’s cool. And hopefully you can hear me. Can you guys hear me?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 88, "phrase": "Okay. All right. Great."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 90, "phrase": "Well, thanks for coming. I think it’s been an incredible year and I’d like to just thank you for your support through tough times, good times. It’s been great. Really appreciate everyone who’s put their heart and money into Tesla and I think it’s worked out pretty well. This has been a good year. And I think there’s many good years to come. So I’ll go through the shareholder presentation fairly quickly because the real main event here is Battery Day. And really, I’m just going through a recap of what’s happened over the past a year or so."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 92, "phrase": "I think starting from in terms of our ability to create a …"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 94, "phrase": "In terms of our ability to create a factory, huge kudos to the Tesla Shanghai team for being able to go from literally a dirt pile to volume production in 15 months. It’s like, damn. Yeah. And I think something that’s really quite noteworthy here is Tesla’s the only foreign manufacturer to have a hundred percent owned factory in China. So this is often not well understood or not appreciated, but to have the only hundred percent owned foreign factory in China is a really big deal, and it’s paying huge dividends here. So we really wouldn’t have the results that we have had this year without the great efforts of the Tesla China team, so I’m super appreciative of that, and we’ll see the Shanghai factory continue to scale quite a bit from where it is right now. I think we really could expect that to be, over time, a factory that produces over a million vehicles a year."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 96, "phrase": "Yeah, it’s cool. So let’s see. So we also reached in the past year of volume production of the Model Y, and this was the smoothest launch that we’ve ever had, so I think we’re definitely getting better at a new vehicle launches and building factories and scaling production. As you’ve heard me say before, the hardest thing is scaling production, especially of a new technology. It’s insanely difficult. Making a prototype is relatively easy, and if I think, like, what is the real achievement of Tesla in sort of car company terms, it’s like it wasn’t making sort of exciting prototypes. It was that Tesla was really the first company in about a century in the U.S., the first U.S. company in the U.S. to reach volume production and be sustainably profitable. The crazy thing is this has really not happened in a hundred years. That’s the actual super hard part, and we now have four vehicles in volume production, S3XY. Also, the toughest joke I think maybe ever. It was a very difficult joke to make."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 98, "phrase": "So we also introduced the lowest cost solar in the U.S. It’s only a dollar 49 a watt, and we really just simplified the whole value chain, so reduced sales and advertising, got rid of a bunch of unnecessary costs, and really are just relying upon the fact that it’s just the lowest cost, most efficient solar in the U.S., providing both a retrofit and the solar glass roof, which I think is a really great product. A hard product to make work, but it will be a major pipeline in the future."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 100, "phrase": "And we also got four consecutive quarters of gap profitability, which was very difficult. Yeah. And certainly a testament to the hard work of people at Tesla. I mean, to do this in extremely difficult times against a wide range of adverse circumstances was insanely hard, but we got it done, and I think the future is looking I think, very promising from a sort of an annual profitability standpoint. So in order to sort of do well financially, you really need economies of scale, and you need ideally the best technology, and I think we’ve had the best technology for a while, but now we are also achieving economies of scale, and we’re also rapidly improving autonomy, which is a massive value add to each car. So, I think the value of Tesla is going to be like total, just on the vehicle side, total vehicles produced times the value of autonomy. That’s a way to think about the future value of Tesla."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 102, "phrase": "We also have consistent free cashflow generation. This is really important for growth, and a key element here is tightening up the time from when a car is ordered to when it is built and delivered. So for a company that is growing rapidly, it’s extremely important to tighten the supply chain and to have, from when parts arrive, put it into a car very quickly and deliver the car very quickly to the customer. And if you can do that inside soft of your payables timeline, then the faster you grow, the more cash you have. Or conversely, if you’re unable to do it within your payables timeline, the faster you grow, the less money you will have, which is obviously bad for capital intensive situation. So just tightening up and having the parts move very quickly to the factory, put it in a car, get it to a customer makes a massive difference to cashflow generation."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 104, "phrase": "I mean, that’s why it’s extremely important to have a factory in each continent, because if you don’t at least have a factory in the continent, it isn’t impossible to achieve this. So having a factory in China, that’s able to serve China, and then soon many other countries in the region will be key to us tightening that total sort of chain of cashflow, and essentially the faster we grow, the more cash. This is really important. That’s also why it’s important to have Giga Berlin complete, because then we’ll have a factory in China, a factory in the U.S. and soon a second factory in the U.S. in Austin, and a factory in Europe."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 106, "phrase": "I mean, even if for Giga Texas in Austin, even if we had exactly the same cost as in California, it would still be advantageous to do it there because it’s roughly two-thirds of the way across the U.S., so in terms of delivering cars to the central U.S. and to the East Coast, it’s just faster, it costs less, and it fundamentally improves our economics. So I think this is also maybe something that’s not fully appreciated of just how important it is to have a factory at least on the continent or reasonably close to where the end customers is, so you can tighten that whole chain."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 108, "phrase": "Industry performance. While the rest of industry is, has gone down, Tesla has gone up, I think this speaks to … Thanks. And so I’d like to thank all the customers for taking a chance on Tesla and buying our product and really hope you’re enjoying it. This is really, our sales, as [inaudible 01:15:21] was saying, it really grew by word of mouth, so this is really, I think it’s very pure in the sense that it’s growing on the basis of existing owners recommending it to others to new customers. This is, really, I think, a good way to grow."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 110, "phrase": "So, and then in 2019 we had 50% growth, and I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020. Probably somewhere between 30-40% growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances. I mean, there’s so many. Pandemic, the wildfires. It’s a whole bunch of difficult production issues, but thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team and a lot of innovative approaches to overcoming issues, we’re able to still see significant growth in one of the most difficult. In fact, I’d say probably the most difficult year of Tesla’s existence."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 112, "phrase": "We also published our extended impact report. At Tesla, we try very hard to do the right thing. If what I think does not happen, it’s just because we maybe made a mistake or weren’t aware of it, but we always try to do the right thing to the best of our ability, and then we published the extended impact report to show just a self-examination of, okay, what are we doing, right? What are we doing wrong? What can we do better in the future? We’re definitely trying to accomplish the most good, and so if we occasionally make a mistake, we work quickly to fix it and do the right thing. So it’s worth looking at the average life cycle of emissions in the U.S. and just how much better a Tesla is or electric car than any kind of gasoline car, and what we’ll talk about in the Battery Day is also just how much the grids around the world, and actually especially in the U.S., are greening. It’s actually much faster than I think people realize, the U.S. is moving towards sustainable energy. And so as we move more and more to sustainable energy, then effectively you end up building the solar factories and the car factories themselves with solar or with sustainable energy. Over time, you will even mine with sustainable energy, and eventually it will get to an effective emissions of zero, so that’s where things will end up. Yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 114, "phrase": "So we also have safety at the core of our design. The Tesla cars are the safest cars ever designed. We have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the U.S. government, And that’s just passive safety. When you add active safety into that, it’s even better, so it’s really … If safety is important to you, which obviously it is, the safest car you could drive is a Tesla. So I think some people aren’t aware of this, but it’s really safety is paramount. It is actually the number one design objective when we build a Tesla is safety."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 116, "phrase": "Our factories are also becoming safer, and if you look at the sort of accidents per vehicle, total vehicle made it’s dramatically better than in the past, and it’s already better than industry average, and we’re confident we can get it to the best in the auto industry. Autopilot functionality continues to improve, and you can see it in the safety report that we publish every quarter. It’s just getting better and better. The U.S. average for collisions is at roughly 2.1 per million miles, and with autopilot engaged, it’s 0.3. I mean, this is a profound difference, really massive, and this will get even better. So we’re confident that over time we can get the probability of an accident, especially the probability of injury, to 10 times better than the industry average, like an order of magnitude better. So that’s just a lot of lives saved and a lot of injuries avoided, so that’s a huge priority for us."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 118, "phrase": "Yeah, the autopilot front, I think it’s hard for people to judge the progress of autopilot. I’m driving … As a matter of course, I’ve always done this. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build of autopilot, and so I sort of have insight into what is going on. Previously about a couple of years ago, we were kind of stuck in a local maximum, so we’re improving, but the improvements kind of started tailing off and just not getting where they needed to be. I call this sort of getting trapped in a local maximum, and so we had to do a fundamental rewrite of the entire autopilot software stack and all of the labeling software as well."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 120, "phrase": "So we are now labeling in 3D video, so this is hugely different from the previously where we were labeling essentially a bunch of single images from the eight cameras, and they would be labeled at different times by different people, and some of the labels, you literally can’t tell what it is you’re labeling. So it basically made it sort of in some cases impossible to label, and the labels had a lot of errors. Now with our new labeling tools, we label it in video, so we actually label entire video segments in the system, so you get basically a surround video thing to label with the surround video and with time. So it’s now taking all cameras simultaneously and looking at how the image has changed over time and labeling that, and then the sophistication of the neural nets in the car and the overall logic in the car has improved dramatically."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 122, "phrase": "I think we’ll hopefully release a private beta of autopilot, of the full self-driving version of autopilot in, I think, a month or so, and then people will really understand just the magnitude of the change. It’s profound. So, yeah. Anyway, so you’ll see it. It’s just like a hell of a step change, but because we had to rewrite everything, labeling software, just the entire code base, it took us quite a while. The sort of new … I call it like 4D in the sense that it’s three dimensions plus time. It’s just taken us a while to rewrite everything, and so you’ll see what it’s like. It’s amazing. Yeah. It’s just clearly going to work."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 124, "phrase": "At Tesla, the core competencies, we’ve got engineering, obviously, but also manufacturing. I think manufacturing is underappreciated in general, and the difficulty of designing the machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself. So the designing, like making a Model 3 or Model Y or Cybertruck truck prototype is really quite trivial compared to designing the factory that makes it, especially if it’s new technology, and you want to use new manufacturing methods. It’s just at least 10 to 100 times harder to do the factory than the prototype, and that’s why you see a lot of companies out there or startups they’ll bring out a prototype, but they just can’t get it over the hump for who manufacturing, because manufacturing of new technology especially is the hardest thing by fa. Basically, the prototype is at best 10% of the difficulty and probably closer to 1%."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 126, "phrase": "And then software. Tesla is both a hardware and a software company, so a huge percentage of our engineers are actually software engineers, and you can think of our car as kind of like a laptop on wheels, so software is incredibly important. Actually, not just in the car, but also in the factory. So the factory software is extremely important. Just software in general. I mean, these are fundamental. These are the three critical areas that are needed to make for an awesome company. So, yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 128, "phrase": "So we have … Now we’ll soon have three new factories incremental on … Well, we have one already. On three different continents. Shanghai, we’re expanding the Shanghai with the second phase. Berlin is making rapid progress, and Texas is making even faster progress. So, yeah. With each factory, what we’re trying to do is also improve the manufacturing technology, so in some cases like the Model Y made in Berlin might look the same, but it actually is made in a much more efficient way. Yeah, we’ll talk about that later in the battery presentation."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 130, "phrase": "Yeah, we launched Megapack. It’s three megawatt hours all in one energy storage solution, so it’s been great overall. Yeah. All right. And I think that’s basically it, right? All right, thank you. All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for coming, and we’ll be back in a little bit to go through the battery stuff, and there’s a little bit more. In addition to the battery stuff, we’ve got a few extras as well. So I think you’ll really like what we have to say on batteries."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 132, "phrase": "The battery stuff we’re going to talk about is truly revolutionary and essential to Tesla’s goal. The fundamental good of Tesla, it’s like, if you look back in history and say, “What good did Tesla do?” The good will by how many years did we accelerate sustainable energy? That’s the true metric of success. It matters if sustainable energy happens faster or slower, and so that’s really how I think about Tesla and how we should assess our progress. By how many years did we accelerate sustainable energy? And what we’re going to talk about with batteries and a few other things will really explain how we’re going to make a step change improvement in the acceleration of sustainable energy. Thank you.

So anyway, there is a lot of good …"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 168, "phrase": "There is a lot of good news though. A lot of people may not be aware that that wind and solar comprise 75% of new electricity capacity in the US this year. So this is really major. So the grid is going sustainable very quickly. Now, it’s also worth noting that the length of time that power plants lasts is on the order of 25 years. So even if a hundred percent of energy generation was sustainable, it will still take 25 years to convert the grid. And it’s also worth noting that in the past 10 years, power production from coal has dropped in half. So it went from 46% of electricity in 2010 to 23% in 2020. So this is a massive improvement. So good things are happening on a lot of levels. We just need to go faster."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 170, "phrase": "So Tesla’s contribution, we’ve delivered over a million electric vehicles, 26 billion electric miles driven, and many gigawatt hours of stationary batteries, 17 terawatt hours of solar generated. So I think solar is sometimes underweighted at Tesla, but it is a massive part of our future. The three parts of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, storage, and electric vehicles. So we intend to play a significant role in all three. So to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, we must produce more EVs that need to be affordable and a lot more energy storage, while building factories faster and with far less investment. So goal number one is a terawatt hour scale battery production. So tera is the new giga. And a terawatt is a thousand times more than a gigawatt. So we used to talk in terms of gigawatts, in the future, we’ll be talking in terms of terawatt hours. So this is what’s needed in order to transition the world to sustainability."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 172, "phrase": "Yeah, and you can see it’s… We’re talking about a hundred X growth in batteries for electric vehicles to achieve this mission. And we are going to get there. It’s just a matter of how fast. And our intention is to accelerate it."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 174, "phrase": "Yeah, you basically need on the order of roughly 10 terawatt hours a year of battery production to transition the global fleet of vehicles to electric."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 176, "phrase": "And the average vehicle lasts 15 years. So we’re talking about 150 terawatt hours give or take to transition the whole electric, all vehicles of all types, to electric."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 178, "phrase": "Yeah. So it’s a lot of batteries, basically. And so-"}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 180, "phrase": "Yeah. And then on the grid side, we have a similar mountain to climb, 1600 times growth from today’s grid batteries to go a hundred percent renewable on the grid and to take all of the existing heating fossil fuel uses in homes and businesses, a hundred percent electric."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 182, "phrase": "Yeah. And this number I think might grow even more. As the world economy matures, and as countries with high populations industrialize, we could see this number be even more. But let’s say it’s like roughly 20 to 25 terawatt hours per year sustained for 15 to 25 years to transition the world to renewable. This is a lot."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 184, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 186, "phrase": "So today’s batteries cannot scale fast enough. They’re just too small. For Giga Nevada, 150 gigawatt hours per year is what we probably expect to make out of there. But this is really pretty small in the grand scheme of things. That’s only 0.15 terawatt hours. And it costs too much."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 188, "phrase": "We would need 135 fully built out in Nevada Giga factories to achieve 20 terawatt hours a year. It’s not scalable enough of a solution. We need a dramatic rethink of the cell manufacturing system to scale as fast as we can and should."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 190, "phrase": "Yeah, and I think we should view this as more than just a question of money. Money is sort of an ethereal thing, but it’s really the amount of effort. You have a certain amount of effort in terms of people and machines, and depending on how efficient that effort is, for a given amount of effort, you want the most amount of batteries. So it’s not just the question of well, if we have $2 trillion, tomorrow you could make this. It’s not that easy. You actually need to organize a massive number of people, build a lot of machines, build the machines that make the machines. And so it’s incredibly important to have that effort yield the most number of batteries."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 192, "phrase": "So, and then goal two, obviously we need to make more affordable cars. I think one of the things that troubles me the most is that we don’t yet have a truly affordable car, and that is something that we will make in the future. But in order to do that, we’ve got to get the cost of batteries down. We’ve got to make, and we’ve got to be better at manufacturing. And we need to do something about this curve. The curve of the cost per kilowatt hour of batteries is not improving fast enough. So we’ve given this a lot of thought over many years to say, okay, how can we radically improve the cost per kilowatt hour curve? It’s been somewhat flattening out actually in recent years."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 194, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, early growth was promising, but you can see we’re kind of plateauing. So that’s what’s motivating us to rethink how cells are produced and designed."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 196, "phrase": "Yeah, exactly. So yeah. And EV market share is growing, but EVs still aren’t accessible to all. And you can see, as you Drew were saying, it’s like starting to flatten out a little bit because the rate of improvement of the affordability of cars is just not fast enough. So that’s why we’ve got Battery Day."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 198, "phrase": "Yeah. To make the best cars in the world, we designed vehicles in factories from the ground up. Next. And now we do this for batteries as well."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 200, "phrase": "Yeah. It’s weird, the slides don’t show up quite right here. What shows up on the screen is not quite what shows up there."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 202, "phrase": "Oh, okay."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 204, "phrase": "It’s different."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 206, "phrase": "Yeah. I think it’s because that’s… Yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 208, "phrase": "That one’s current, supposed to be current. Whatever."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 210, "phrase": "So let’s get started. We have a plan to have the cost per kilowatt hour. And it’s not a plan that rests on a single innovation, some research project that will never see the light of day. It’s a plan that has taken creative engineering and industrialization across every facet of what makes a cell into a battery pack, from raw material to the finished thing. And we’re going to go through that plan with you today, step-by-step, and build up how we get to these goals and how we accelerate this transition and make our vehicles and our grid batteries more affordable."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 212, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, we basically thought through every element of the battery, or almost every element. There are a few more elements that we won’t get to today, but we will get to in the future."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 214, "phrase": "Yes. So first before we get too far into it, let’s talk about what is in a battery cell. We’ve got the cap and the can, negative and positive terminals of the cell. When you open that cell, you’ve got a tab connected to those terminals, what we call the jelly roll, which is the wound electrodes on the inside. You can actually see what this looks like as you unwind it. This is over a meter long in a typical 2170 cell. So it’s quite a long winding process. And you can see the tab still there. And then to explain what’s actually going on here, we’ve identified, we’ve got anode, cathode, separator, positive and negative terminal."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 216, "phrase": "Watch what happens as we, there we go, discharge the cell. Got lithium moving from anode to cathode. And then the reverse when we charge the cell, lithium moving from cathode to anode across the separator. This is the basic of what makes all lithium-ion batteries, no matter what the form factor is. And when we look at what’s happened today, at least in our products, we’ve moved from the 18650 form factor to the 2170 form factor through great collaboration with our partners, Panasonic, new partners like LG and CATL and probably others in the future."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 218, "phrase": "Actually, slight note on why is the one called 18650, although not on the slide, versus the 2170, is that the first two digits refer to the diameter, and the second two digits refer to the length. So that helps explain what’s up with these weird numbers. But nobody could explain to me why there was an extra zero. So I, so I said, “Okay, well, we’re deleting the zero that nobody can explain in future form factors.” So that’s why it’s technically, it’s like the 18650 bizarrely, but going forward it’s the 2170, because we just got rid of the extra zero because it’s pointless."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 220, "phrase": "And this was a evolutionary step going from 1865 to 2170, bringing 50% more energy into the cell. But when we look to the ideal cell design, if we were to do it ourselves, we need to go beyond just what we’re looking at us in front of us and study the full spectrum of options. So as you can see, we kind of swept the key figures of merit, how much we can reduce the cost and how much vehicle range increases as we change the outer diameter of the cell. We found a sweet spot somewhere around 46 millimeters. But it’s not just about a bigger form factor. Anybody could make a bigger form factor."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 222, "phrase": "Any fool, any fool could make a bigger form factor. Are we not any fool?"}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 224, "phrase": "Yeah, exactly. There are problems as you make cells larger. In fact, supercharging and thermals in general become really challenging as you make bigger cells. And this was the challenge that our team set our sights on to overcome. And we did, we came up with this tabless architecture that maybe you’ve heard about, that basically removes the thermal problem from the equation and allows us to go to the absolute lowest cost form factor and the simplest manufacturing process. And this is what we mean when we talk about tabless. It’s kind of a beautiful thing."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 226, "phrase": "Yeah. That’s what these t-shirts mean, but it’s very esoteric. It was like, nobody could figure it out."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 228, "phrase": "Yeah, we basically took the existing foils, laser pattered them, and enabled dozens of connections into the active material through this shingled spiral you can see with simpler manufacturing, fewer parts, 50 millimeter versus 250 millimeter electrical path length, which is how we get all the thermal benefits."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 230, "phrase": "Yeah. This is important to appreciate. Basically the distance that that electron has to travel, it’s just much less. So you actually have a shorter path length in a large tabless cell than you have in the smaller cell with tabs. This is a big deal. So even though the cell is bigger, it actually has more power. The power to weight ratio is actually better than the smaller cell with tabs. This is, again, this is quite hard to do it. Nobody’s done it before and it really took a tremendous amount of effort within Tesla engineering to figure out how do we make a frigging tabless cell and have it actually work and then connect that to the top cap. There’s a whole bunch of things that we’re keeping a little secret sauce here that we’re not telling everything, but-"}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 232, "phrase": "Sometimes what’s elegant and simple is still hard. And it took us a lot of trials, but we’re happy where we ended up."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 234, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, everything is simple in recollection, after you… it’s hard until it’s discovered and then it’s simple. So anyway, there’s a lot of really cool things going on that enable tabless. And it was really due to a really great engineering team. Drew and the rest of the team had done amazing work in achieving this tabless construction. I think it may sort of sound a bit silly to some people, but for people that really know cells, this is a massive breakthrough."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 236, "phrase": "For cylindricals to be able to get rid of the tabs dramatically simplifies winding and coding. And has an awesome thermal and performance benefit."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 238, "phrase": "Yeah. Just to elaborate on that a bit, it’s like when the cell is going through the system, it has to keep stopping where all the tabs are. So you can’t do a continuous motion production if you have tabs. You have to keep stopping and then there’s a rate at which you can start and stop and accelerate again and it really slows down the rate of production. And then sometimes you get the tabs wrong and you also lose a little bit of active area. It’s really a huge pain in the ass to have tabs from a production standpoint."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 240, "phrase": "Yes. And so when we put it all together and go to our new 80 millimeter length, 4680 we call this a new cell design, we get five times the energy with six times the power and enable 16% range increase, just form factor alone."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 242, "phrase": "Yeah. So these… Yeah. It’s pretty great. And just to clarify, when we see these plus 16% or whatever the percentage rate increase is, these are the amounts due just to that particular innovation. So we’ll list a whole bunch of innovations and then when you add them up, you get a total improvement in energy density and cost. But these numbers are what refer to just this thing."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 244, "phrase": "Yeah. And I want to stress, this is not just a concept or a rendering. We’re starting to ramp up manufacturing of these cells at our pilot 10 gigawatt hour production facility, just around the corner."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 246, "phrase": "Yeah. So. Yeah. It’s a video of some of what’s going on in the plant. Now. I mean, to be clear, it will take about a year to reach the 10 gigawatt hour capacity. So this is important to appreciate. When you build a factory, there’s a certain capacity that you design to, and then it takes some period of time to actually achieve that capacity. So I would say it’s probably about a year before we get to the 10 gigawatt hour annualized rate with the pilot plant. And this is just a pilot plant. The actual production plants will be more on the order of maybe 200 gigawatt hours, maybe more over time."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 248, "phrase": "And… Thank you. But let’s stack up everything we just saw at the cell level. So just the cell form factor change enables a 14% dollar per kilowatt hour reduction, just that cell form factor change. And now that you’ve been teased on this factory, we’re going to go on and walk step-by-step through that factory and discuss a series of innovations there. When thinking about the ideal cell factory, we have inspirations behind us in the paper and bottling industry, where from humble beginnings, over a century of innovation has enabled mass scale, continuous motion, unbelievably low manufacturing costs. And when we think about the lithium-ion industry, which is really only in its third decade of high volume production, it has so far to go to achieve similar scale and simplicity. And that was the inspiration that we set out to the team as we thought about how to marry cell design and manufacturing in the best possible factory."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 250, "phrase": "And let’s talk a little bit about what’s in a cell factory. First, there’s an electrode process where the active materials are coated into films onto foils. Then those coated foils are wound in the winding process we just talked about where if you do have tabs, you have to start and stop a lot. Then the jelly roll is assembled into the can, sealed, filled with electrolyte, and then sent to formation where the cell is charged for the first time and where the sort of the electrochemistry is set and the quality of the cell is verified. And we set out at every step of this process to try to take that inspiration we just showed and think about how we make those processes fundamentally better and more scalable. And one of the most important processes is where it all begins, the wet process of the electrode coding. And just to give you all a sense of scale, I’m going to walk through what’s in that wet process."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 252, "phrase": "You’ve got mixing where the powders are mixed with either a water or a solvent, solvents for the cathode. That mix then goes into a large coat and dry oven where the slurry is coated onto the foil, huge ovens, tens of meters long, dried, and that solvent then has to be recovered. You can see the solvent recovery system. And then finally the coated foil is compressed to the final density. And when you’re looking at this, you’re like, wow, that’s a lot of equipment for one step, especially when you consider that little spec next to the coating oven is a person. This is serious iron involved in making batteries. Wouldn’t it be great if we could skip that solvent step, which is one of those dig a ditch, and then fill it kind of things where you put the solvent in and then take it out and recycle it, and just go straight to a dry mix to coat? And that’s what the dry process really is about. And in the most basic form, you can see it here on a benchtop, literally powder into film, as simple as that."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 254, "phrase": "I mean, it’s hard actually, just to be clear. If this was easy, everyone would do it. It’s not like dry coating electrode is actually easy. It’s actually very hard to do what appears to be a simple thing. And it’s worth noting, we did acquire Maxwell a little over a year ago, I guess, and certainly a good company and everything, but the dry coating they had was like, it’s like sort of, I would call proof of concept. Since the acquisition. We’ve actually ramped the machine that does dry coating four times. So revision full post acquisition of the machine, and there’s still a lot of work to do. So I would not say this is completely in the bag. It’s still a lot of work to do. And as you grow, as you scale, go from benchtop to lab to pilot to volume production, there are actually major issues that you encounter at every level. It’s not like you make something work on your bench and bingo, now you can make a bazillion of it."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 256, "phrase": "Absolutely."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 258, "phrase": "It’s insanely difficult to scale up. Yeah."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 260, "phrase": "Yeah, but if you do scale it up, what you saw before becomes this. So you can see the motivation. A 10 times reduction in footprint, a 10 times reduction in energy and a massive reduction in investment. But as Elon was saying, simple is hard."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 262, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, to be clear, I would like to not say that right now, it just totally working. It’s close to working, but it’s not, even now at the pilot plant level, it is close to working. It’s fair to say probably it does work, but with not a good, not a high yield."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 264, "phrase": "Yeah. We’re still ironing out the kinks, but we’ve made tens of thousands of cells, thousands of kilometers of electrode. I mean, we are on the fourth generation of the equipment so we’ve learned a lot along the way. I mean, it is super demanding because every atom has its place if you want to deliver the energy density and the cycle life and the supercharging. But we’re confident that we will get there, but it will be a lot of work along that."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 266, "phrase": "There’s a clear path to success, but a ton of work between here and there. But this is a really profound improvement. Again, for people that know battery manufacturing, this is gigantic. We’ll probably be on machine revision six or seven by the time we do large scale production. The rate at which the machines are being improved is extremely rapid. Literally every three or four months, there’s a new rev."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 268, "phrase": "Yeah. And beyond the electrode, we continue to innovate on every other process steps. So let’s talk a little bit about assembly, which is next. The key to a high-performing assembly line is accomplishing processes while in motion, continuous motion. And thinking of the line as a highway, max velocity down the highway, no start and stop, no city driving."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 270, "phrase": "Exactly, no stop lights and traffic lights sort of thing. You want the highway."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 272, "phrase": "You want the highway. And together with our internal design team that makes this equipment and designs this equipment, we coupled thinking about how to make the best cell with thinking about how to make the best equipment so that we could accomplish the fastest parts per minute rates on all of these tools. And through all of that development, we were able to get to the point where we can implement assembly lines, one line, 20 gigawatt hours, seven times increase in output per line. And when you’re thinking about scalability and pure effort, having one line be seven X the capability is just effort multiplying."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 274, "phrase": "Yeah. So you can sort of think about the sort of the fundamental physics of a factory or something. I think it’s actually quite a lot like the rocket equation where you’ve got basically the rocket equation you’ve got your exhaust velocity and then the log of [end 02:05:24] masses. So it’s basically saying how fast are things going and what percentage of the factory volume is doing useful work? And conveyance does not count as useful work."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 276, "phrase": "Only the value added steps."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 278, "phrase": "Yeah. If you break the factory down into cubic meter sections and say… or smaller. Could be like one liter sections, and say, “Is a majority of this volume of doing useful work?” You’d be astounded at how bad most factories are. They’d be like maybe two or 3%, including our factory in Fremont. So I think it’s possible to get to at least 10 times that of volumetric efficiency. So more like 30%ish, maybe more, and be 10x better, which means the factory can be 10 times smaller. And then the other thing is how fast are things going through the factory? It’s like speed and density. A factory that’s moving at say twice the speed of another factory is equivalent to two factories basically. And the company that will be successful is the company that with one factory can accomplish what other companies take two or three or four factories to do. So this is what we’re trying to do here is say, okay, how do we, with one factory achieve what maybe five or even 10 factories would normally be required to achieve?"}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 280, "phrase": "And the vertical integration with the machine design teams at Grohmann and Hibar and others allows us to really accomplish that because we don’t have any of these edge conditions between one piece of equipment and another, we can design the entire machine to be one machine and remove all of these unnecessary steps."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 282, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, basically Tesla is aiming to be the best at manufacturing of any company on Earth. This is the thing that’s actually most important in the long run I think, just from a company standpoint and from basically achieving sustainability as fast as possible. But I think also for long-term competitiveness, eventually every car company will have long range electric cars. Eventually every company will have autonomy, I think, but not every company will be a great at manufacturing. Tesla will be absolutely head and shoulders above anyone else in manufacturing, that is our goal."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 284, "phrase": "Manufacturing is hard and hard problems are fun to solve. Okay. Now let’s talk about formation. In a typical cell factory, formation represents 25% of the investment. And what is formation? Is it’s charging and discharging cells and verifying the quality of the cell. It turns out we’ve charged and discharged billions and billions of cells in our vehicles so we know a thing or two about that. The typical formation set up is you charge and discharge each cell individually. In our car, we charge thousands of cells at once. And we took our principal and our power electronics, leveraging Powerwall vehicle battery management systems and others to dramatically improve the formation equipment cost-effectiveness and density. 86% reduction in formation investment, 75% reduction in footprint. You want to take this one?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 286, "phrase": "Sure. So essentially what this translates to based on what we know today is about a 75% reduction in the investment per kilowatt hour. Or gigawatt hour. It’s just basically four times better than the current state of the art to the best of our knowledge. And I think there’s probably room to improve even beyond that."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 288, "phrase": "Definitely."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 290, "phrase": "Definitely. Yeah. So we’re able to, from a volume standpoint, actually get what, in a smaller form factor than Giga Nevada, we’re able to get many times the cell output. So you can see basically we can get a terawatt hour in less space than it took to make a gigawatt hour, 150 gigawatt hours. So this is pretty profound. I would actually not have thought this was possible several years ago, that we could actually get to a terawatt scale in less space than what we currently envisioned for doing 150 gigawatt hours."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 292, "phrase": "Yes. Simpler accelerates terawatt scale. And that’s what we need to do to accelerate our mission. And as Elon said, we’re going to try to even improve on this as we push towards our goals, which are…"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 294, "phrase": "Yeah. So this is just talking about Tesla internal cell production. As I tweeted out earlier, we will continue to use our cell suppliers, Panasonic and LG and CATL. And so this is a hundred gigawatt hours supplemental to what we buy from suppliers. And yeah, essentially, this does reduce our weighted average cost of a sale, but it allows us to make a lot more cars and a lot more stationary storage. And then long-term, we’re expecting to make on the order of a 3000 gigawatt hours or three terawatt hours per year. I think we’ve got a good chance of achieving this actually before 2030, but I’m highly confident that we could do it by 2030."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 296, "phrase": "When you look at the size of that factory on the previous page, it really shows how enabling all of these advancements are in achieving a three terawatt hour goal by 2030.

So we have a manufacturing system, we’ve got a cell design. What are the active materials we’re going to put in that cell design? Let’s talk about the anode first. Let’s talk about silicon. Why is silicon awesome? It’s awesome because it’s the most abundant element in the Earth’s crust after oxygen, which means it’s everywhere. It’s sand."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 302, "phrase": "Sand is silicon dioxide."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 304, "phrase": "And it happens to store nine times more lithium than graphite, which is the typical anode material in lithium-ion batteries today. So why isn’t everybody using it? The main reason is because the challenge with silicon is that it expands four X when fully charged with lithium. And basically all of that expansion stress on the particle, the particles start cracking, they start electrically isolating, you lose capacity. The energy retention of the battery starts to fade. And it also gumps up with a passivation layer that has to keep reforming as the particles expand."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 306, "phrase": "Yeah. Basically with silicon, the cookie crumbles and gets gooey. That’s basically what happens."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 308, "phrase": "Good analogy. And current approaches to solve this, which exist, I mean, we have silicon in the cars that you’re all in right now, involved highly engineered, expensive materials in the scheme of things. Now they’re still great and they enable some of the benefits of silicon. They just don’t enable all of it and they’re not scalable enough. And you can see some of the things that maybe you’ve heard of, SIO, silicon with carbon, or silicon nanowires. That’s kind of the space right now. What we’re proposing is a step change in capability and a step change in cost. And what that really is is to just go to the raw metallurgical silicon itself, don’t engineer the base metal, just start with that and design for it to expand in how you think of the particle in the electrode design and how you coat it."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 310, "phrase": "Yeah. And I’m not sure if you saw this. Basically a dollar per kilowatt hours basically. If you use simple silicon, it’s dramatically less than even the silicon that is currently used in the batteries that are made today, and you can use a lot more of it."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 312, "phrase": "The anode would cost, yeah, with this silicon, the anode costs a dollar and 20 cents a kilowatt hour."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 314, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 316, "phrase": "And how does it work? Start with raw metallurgical silicon, stabilize the surface with an elastic ion conducting polymer coating that is applied through a very scalable approach. No chemical vapor deposition, no highly engineered high capacity, high cap ex solutions, and then integrate it into the electrode through a robust network formed out of a highly elastic binder. And in the end, by leveraging this silicon to its potential, we can increase the range of our vehicles by an additional 20%. Just this improvement."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 318, "phrase": "Yeah. It gets cheaper and longer range. Okay."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 320, "phrase": "Yeah. And when we take that anode cost reduction, we’re looking at another 5% dollar per kilowatt hour reduction at the battery pack level. And there’s more. Let’s talk about cathodes. What is a battery cathode? Cathodes are like bookshelves where the metal, the nickel, the cobalt, the manganese or aluminum is like the shelf, and the lithium is the book. And really what sets apart these different metals is how many books of lithium they can fit on the shelves and how sturdy the shelves are. Cobalt is a-"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 322, "phrase": "Sorry, I was going to say it’s tough to exactly figure out what the right analogy is to explain a cathode and anode. But a bookshelf is probably a pretty good one in the sense that you need a stable structure to contain the ions. So you want a structure that does not crumble or get gooey, or basically that that holds its shape in both the cathode and the anode. As you’re moving these ions back and forth, it needs to retain its structure. So if it doesn’t retain a structure, then you lose cycle life and your battery capacity drops very quickly."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 324, "phrase": "Absolutely. Yeah. I totally agree. And I think people are always talking about like, oh, what’s the catheter going to be? Is it [NCA 02:15:38] or whatever? The thing to consider is just fundamentally what the nickel, the metals are capable of. And that’s what we have on the chart here. Dollar per kilowatt hour cathode of just the metal using just LME, London Metal Exchange prices, versus the energy density of just the cathode. And you can see nickel is the cheapest and the highest energy density. And that’s why increasing nickel is a goal of ours and really everybody’s in the energy-"}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 326, "phrase": "Why increasing nickel is a goal of ours, and really everybody’s in the battery industry. But one of the reasons why cobalt is even used at all is because it is a very stable bookshelf. And the challenge with going to pure nickel is stabilizing that bookshelf with only nickel. And that’s what we’ve been working on with our high nickel cathode development, which has zero cobalt in it, leveraging novel coatings and dopants We can get a 15% reduction in cathode dollar per kilowatt hour."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 328, "phrase": "Yeah. Big deal."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 330, "phrase": "But it’s not just about nickel. You want a?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 332, "phrase": "Yeah. Sure. So in order to scale, we really need to make sure that we’re not constrained by total nickel availability. I actually spoke with the CEOs of the biggest mining companies in the world and said, “Please make more nickel, this is very important.” And so I think they are going to make more nickel. I think we need to have a kind of a three-tiered approach to batteries."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 334, "phrase": "So starting with iron, that’s kind of like a medium range, and then nickel manganese as sort of a medium plus intermediate and then high nickel for long range applications like Cyber Truck and the semi. Something like a semi-truck, it’s extremely important to have high energy density in order to get long range. And just to give sort of iron up a bit more time, if you look at [inaudible 02:17:37] per kilogram at the cathode level of iron, it looks like nickel’s twice as good, but when you fully consider it at the pack level, everything else taken into account, nickel is about maybe 50 or 60% better than iron."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 336, "phrase": "So iron is a little better than it would seem, when you look at it at the pack level fully considered. It’s not as good as nickel, nickel’s like 50 to 60% better, but it’s actually pretty good. Good for stationary storage and for medium range applications where energy density is not paramount. And then, like I said, for intermediate, it’s kind of a nickel manganese, and it’s a relatively straightforward to do a cathode that’s two-thirds nickel one third manganese, which would then allow us to make 50% more cell volume with the same amount of nickel."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 338, "phrase": "And with very little energy trade-off. Just enough to have, you still want to use 100% nickel for something like a semi-truck, but really not much of a sacrifice at all."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 340, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 342, "phrase": "And beyond the metals, because a lot of people spend time talking about the metals. Actually the cathode process itself is a big target. 35% of the cathode dollar per kilowatt hour is just in transferring it into its final form. And so we see that as a big target. And we decided to take that on."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 344, "phrase": "Here’s a view of the traditional cathode process. Effectively, if you start at the left and you have the metal from the mine, the first thing that happens is the metal from the mine is changed into an intermediate thing called a metal sulfate, because that just happened to be what chemists wanted a long time ago. And then when you’re making the cathode you have to take this intermediate thing called the metal sulfate fate, add chemicals, add a whole bunch of water, a whole bunch of stuff happens in the middle, and at the end you get that little bit of cathode and a whole bunch of wastewater and byproducts."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 346, "phrase": "It’s insanely complicated. It’s a small world journey of, “I am a nickel atom, what happens to me?” And it is crazy. You’re going around the world three times, there’s the moral equivalent of digging the ditch, filling the ditch and digging the ditch again, it’s total madness basically. And these things just grew up, they’re just kind of like legacy things, it’s like how it was done before and then they connected the dots but really didn’t think of the whole thing from a first principle standpoint saying, “How do we get from the nickel ore in the ground to the finished nickel product for a battery?” So we’ve looked at the entire value chain and said, “How can we make this as simple as possible?”"}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 348, "phrase": "And that’s what we’re proposing here with our process. As you can see, a whole lot less is going on here. We get rid of the intermediate, metal, water, final product cathode, recirculate the water, no wastewater at all. And when you summarize all of that it’s a 66% reduction in CapEx investment, a 76 reduction in process costs and zero waste water. Much more scalable solution."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 350, "phrase": "And then when you think about the fact that now we’re actually just directly consuming the raw metal nickel powder, it dramatically simplifies the metal refining part of the whole process. So we can eliminate billions in battery grade nickel intermediate production. It’s not needed at all. And we can also use that same process we showed on the previous page to directly consume the metal powder coming out of recycled electric vehicle and grid storage batteries. So this process enables both simpler mining and simpler recycling."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 352, "phrase": "And now that we have this process, obviously we’re going to go and start building our own cathode facility in North America and leveraging all of the North American resources that exist for nickel and lithium. And just doing that, just localizing our cathode supply chain and production, we can reduce miles traveled by all the materials that end up in the cathode by 80%, which is huge for cost."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 354, "phrase": "Yeah. To be clear, cathode production would be part of our the Tesla cell production plant. So it would just be basically raw materials coming from the mine and from raw materials in the mine out comes a battery."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 356, "phrase": "And on that note, the way the lithium ends up in the cell is through the cathode. So then we should obviously on-site lithium conversion as well, which is what we will do using a new process that we’re going to pioneer. That’s a sulfate-free process again, skip the intermediate, 33% reduction in lithium cost, a hundred percent electric facility co-located with the cathode plant."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 358, "phrase": "So it’s important to note that there is a massive amount of lithium on earth. So lithium is not like oil. There’s a massive amount of it, pretty much everywhere. In fact is there’s enough lithium in the United States to convert the entire United States fleet to electric, all the cars in the United States. Like 300 million or something like that. Every vehicle in the United States can be converted to electric using only lithium that is available in the United States."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 360, "phrase": "Discovered today."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 362, "phrase": "Yeah, what we already know is exist."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 364, "phrase": "People really haven’t even been looking."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 366, "phrase": "Yeah, people haven’t been trying because it’s just widely available. But it is important to say, “Okay, what is the smartest way to take ores and extract the lithium and do so in an environmentally friendly way?” And we actually discovered… Again, looking at it a first principles physics standpoint, instead of just the way it’s always been done, is we found that we can actually use table salt, sodium chloride, to basically extract the lithium from the ores. Nobody’s done this before, to the best of my knowledge, nobody’s done this. And all the elements are reusable, it’s a very sustainable way of obtaining lithium. And we actually got rights to a lithium clay deposit in Nevada."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 368, "phrase": "Over 10,000 acres."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 370, "phrase": "Over 10,000 acres. And then the nature of the mining is actually also very environmentally sensitive in that we sort of take a chunk of dirt out of the ground, remove the lithium, and then put the chunk of dirt back where it was. So it will look pretty much the same as before, it will not look like terrible. And yeah, it’ll be nice."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 372, "phrase": "Simply mix clay with salt, put it in water, salt comes out with the lithium, done."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 374, "phrase": "Yeah. It’s pretty crazy."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 376, "phrase": "Yeah. So we’re really excited about this and there really is enough lithium in Nevada alone to electrify the entire US fleet."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 378, "phrase": "Yeah, that’s true. Actually, just what’s in Nevada. Basically, there’s so much damn lithium on Earth it’s crazy. It’s one of the most common elements on the planet."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 380, "phrase": "And eventually, as we said at the beginning, when we get to this steady state 20 terawatt hours per year of production, we will transfer the entire non-renewable fleet of both power plants, home heating and industry heating and vehicles to electric. And at that point, we have an awesome resource in those batteries to recycle, to make new batteries. So we don’t need to do any more mining at that point. And you can see why. The difference in the value of the material coming back from the vehicle versus the ground, you’d always go to the vehicle. And we recycle a hundred percent of our vehicle batteries today. And actually, we are starting our pilot full-scale recycling production at Gigafactory Reno next quarter to continue to develop this process as our recycling returns grow."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 382, "phrase": "To date, it’s been done by third parties, but we think we can recycle the batteries more effectively, especially since our batteries, we’re making the same battery as the thing we’re recycling. Whereas third party recyclers have to consider batteries of all kinds."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 384, "phrase": "Yeah. And just to think about what this actually means, the recycling resource is always 10 or greater years delayed because batteries last a really long time, but eventually it is the way that all resources will be made available. And that’s why we’re investing in this recycling facility in Nevada."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 386, "phrase": "Yeah. Long-term, new batteries will come from old batteries once the fleet reaches steady state."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 388, "phrase": "Right. Okay. So we just talked about scaling cathode and recycling, all of the benefits that you just saw are added to this benefit of a 12% reduction in dollars per kilowatt hour at the battery pack level, almost at our half of the cost goal, but there’s one more section. Take it away, Elon."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 390, "phrase": "So there’s an architecture that we’ve been wanting to do at Tesla for a long time, and we’ve finally figured it out. And I think it’s the way that all electric cars in the future will ultimately be made, it’s the right way to do things."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 392, "phrase": "So it starts with having a single piece casting for the front body and the rear body. And in order to do this, we commissioned the largest casting machine that has ever been made. And it’s currently working just over the road at our Fremont plant. It’s pretty sweet. Currently making the entire rear section of the car as a single piece, high pressure die-cast aluminum. And in order to do this, we actually had to develop our own alloy because we wanted a high strength casting alloy that did not require coatings or heat treatment. This is a big deal for castings. Especially with a large casting. If you heat treat it afterwards it tends to deform, it kind of does this like potato chip thing. So it’s very hard to keep a large casting to have its shape."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 394, "phrase": "So in order to achieve this, there was no alloy that existed that could do this, so we developed our own alloy, a special allow of aluminum, that has high strength without heat treat and is very castable. So that’s a great achievement of our materials team. In fact, in general, we’ve got a lot of advanced materials coming for Tesla, new alloys and materials that have never existed before."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 396, "phrase": "So, you’re basically making the front and rear of the car is a single piece and that then interfaces to what we call it, the structural battery. Where the battery for the first time will have dual use. The battery will both have the use as an energy device and as structure. This is absolutely the way things are done. In the early days of aircraft they would carry the fuel tanks as cargo. So the fuel tanks actually were quite difficult to carry. They’re basically worse than cargo, you had to add to kind of bolt them down. It was very difficult. And then somebody said, “Hey, what if we just make the fuel tank in wing shape?” So all modern airplanes, your wing is just a fuel tank in wing shape. This is absolutely the way to do it. And then the fuel tanks serves this dual structure, and it’s no longer cargo. It’s fundamental to the structure of the aircraft. This was a major breakthrough. We’re doing the same for cars."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 398, "phrase": "So this is really quite profound. Effectively the non cell portion of the battery has negative mass. So we saved more mass than the rest of the vehicle than the non cell portion of the battery. So it’s like, “How do you really minimize the mass of a battery? Make it negative. Make the non cell portion of battery pack negative.” So it also allows us to pack the cells more densely because we do not have intermediate structure in the battery pack. So instead of having these supports and stabilizers and stringers and structural elements in the battery, we now have a lot more space in the battery because the pack itself is structural."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 400, "phrase": "What we do essentially, instead of having just a filler that is a flame retardant, which is currently what is in the 3NY battery packs, we have a filler that is a structural adhesive, as well as flame-retardant. So it effectively glues the cells to the top and bottom sheet. And this allows you to do shear transfer between upper and lower sheet. Just like if you have a formula one craft or a racing boat, and you have carbon fiber face sheets and aluminum honeycomb between them, this gives you incredible stiffness and it’s really the way that any super fast thing works is you create basically a honeycomb sandwich with two face sheets."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 402, "phrase": "This is actually even better than what aircraft do. Because aircraft do not do this. They can’t do this because fuel is liquid. So in our case the batteries are solid. So we can actually use the steel shell case of the battery to transfer shear from the upper and lower face sheet, which makes for an incredibly stiff structure, even stiffer than a regular car. In fact, if this was a convertible that had no upper structure, that convertible will be stiffer than a regular car. So it’s just really major."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 404, "phrase": "So it improves the mass efficiency of the battery. And then those castings are also quite important because you want to transfer load into the structural battery pack in a very smooth, continuous way. So you don’t put arbitrary point loads into the battery. So you want to sort of feather the load out from the front and rear into the structural battery. It also allows us to move the cells closer to the center of the car, because we don’t have the… In the top one we’ve got all the supports and stuff, so the volumetric efficiency of the structural pack is as much better than a non-structural pack. And we’re going to actually bring the cells closer to the center and because they’re closer to the center it reduces the probability of a side impact potentially contacting the cells because in any kind of side impact has to go further in order to reach the cells."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 406, "phrase": "It also proves what’s called the polar moment of inertia. Which is if you think of when there’s a ice skater arms out or arms in. Arms in, you rotate faster. So if you can bring things closer to the center, you reduce the polar moment of inertia and that means the car maneuvers better. It just feels better. You won’t know why, but it just feels more agile. So it’s really cool. This is really major."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 408, "phrase": "Like it says, so 10% mass reduction in the body of the car, 14% range increase, 370 fewer parts. I really think that long-term in any cars that do not take this architecture will not be competitive,"}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 410, "phrase": "And it’s not just at the product level, a better product. But in the factory, it’s a massive simplification. You saw the part removal, it’s casting machines, it’s the structural battery pack. So we’re looking at over 50% reduction in investment per gigawatt hour, 35% reduction in floor space. And we’ll continue to improve that as we make the vehicle factory of the future."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 412, "phrase": "Yeah. So major improvements on all fronts from the cell all the way to the vehicle."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 414, "phrase": "And in addition to the improvements we just said on enabling additional range and improving the structural performance of the vehicle, it is worth another 7% dollar per kilowatt hour reduction at the battery pack level, bring our total reductions now to 56% dollars per kilowatt."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 416, "phrase": "All right. So stacking it up. We’re not just talking about cost or range. We’ve got to look at all the facets. So range increase, we’re unlocking up to 54% increase in range for our vehicles and energy density for our energy products. 56% reduction in dollars per kilowatt hour at the battery pack level, and a 69% reduction in investment per gigawatt hour, which is the true enabler when we talk back about how do we achieve this scale problem here."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 418, "phrase": "Yeah. So I think it’s pretty nice that investment per gigawatt hour reduction is 69%. I mean, who would have thought?"}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 420, "phrase": "Yeah, just happened to come out that way."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 422, "phrase": "I mean, 0.420%, of course. So what this enables us to do is achieve a new trajectory in the reduction of cell cost. And now to be clear, it will take us probably a year to 18 months to start realizing these advantages and to fully realize the advantages probably it’s about three years or thereabouts. So if we could do this instantly we would, but it just really bodes well for the future and means that the long-term scaling of Tesla and the sustainable energy products that we make will be massively increased. So, what tends to happen as companies get bigger is things tend to slow down, actually they’re going to speed up."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 424, "phrase": "And they have to speed up if we’re going to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 426, "phrase": "Yeah. Long-term we want to try to replace at least 1% of the total vehicle fleet on Earth, which is about 2 billion vehicles. So long-term, we want to try and make about 20 million vehicles a year."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 428, "phrase": "But I think it’s important to point out that when we talked about three terawatt hours by 2030, the problem is a 20 terawatt hour problem. So everybody needs to be accelerating their efforts to accomplish these objectives. It doesn’t matter where you are in the value chain. There is a ton to do, you need to rethink from first principles how you do it, so that you can scale to meet all of our objectives."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 430, "phrase": "Yep."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 432, "phrase": "And, Elon."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 434, "phrase": "Sure."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 436, "phrase": "What does this mean…"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 438, "phrase": "What does this mean for our future products? So we’re confident that long-term we can design and manufacturer a compelling $25,000 electric vehicle. This has always been our dream from the beginning of the company. I even wrote a blog piece about it because our first car was an expensive sports car, then it was a slightly less expensive sedan, and then finally sort of a, I don’t know, mass market premium, the Model 3 and Model Y. But it was always our goal to try to make an affordable electric car.

Because if you try to design a car to meet the super set of all global requirements you can’t make the cyber truck, it’s impossible. So it really is designed for the American market, but this is the biggest market. Our North American market is the biggest market for pickup trucks by far or large pickup trucks."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 500, "phrase": "And then I think we’ll probably make an international version of cyber truck that’ll be kind of smaller, kind of like a tight Wolverine package. It’ll still be cooler, but it’ll be smaller because you just can’t make a giant truck like that for most markets. So, yeah, but it’s going to be great."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 502, "phrase": "And I don’t know. I think probably we’ll be able to sell directly in Texas. We do pretty well right now, but it is a bit weird not being able to actually conclude a transaction in Texas, but it’s got to be like a click on a server based in California. But weirdly we can do leasing in Texas, but not selling. Hopefully that’ll get cleared up in the future."}, {"author": "Speaker 6", "serial_number": 504, "phrase": "Elon, great job with everything that you’re doing. It’s Ross Gerber from Gerber Kawasaki. Your team’s amazing. What I’m most curious about, these innovations are incredible but on my drive up here fully on autopilot for 400 miles, the entire state is brown and this is ultimately about climate. Has there been some analysis done if all these things are achieved, what will its direct impact be on climate?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 506, "phrase": "I think it will have a very significant impact because it will stop the CO2 PPM from growing as it is every year. I should say, I try to view the whole climate thing as a science question as much as possible. Science, you always question your hypothesis, is it true? Is not true? Or assign a probability to a given hypothesis. And I should say that my original interest in electric vehicles predates the climate issue. When I was in high school, I thought, “Man, if we don’t figure out electric cars, the whole economy’s going to collapse when we run out of oil.” So we better figure out electric cars and sustainable energy or civilization’s going to crumble."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 508, "phrase": "And then it was only later that the significance of the climate risk became apparent. And we were also able, using tracking and other types of technology to access a lot more fossil fuels than previously thought, which is helpful for lowering the cost of gasoline, but it’s pretty bad for the total tonnage of CO2 that you could put in the atmosphere. It’s now greatly beyond what people previously thought. As we were just going through this presentation, it is a absolutely monumental task to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. The entire global economy is still more than 99% dependent on, or call it roughly 99% dependent on, fossil fuels. So although electric cars get a lot of press right now, as a percentage of the total global fleet it’s practically nothing. I would say yes, less than 1% of the global fleet is electric right now. Because of two billion cars and trucks and whatnot in use. So there’s a massive amount of work ahead. Just insane, like hard to comprehend how much work is ahead to get the new vehicle production to be sustainable, to massively increase the amount of stationary storage, which is critical because renewable energy is intermittent, wind, and solar is intermittent, sometimes the wind doesn’t blow and this obviously sun doesn’t shine at night, so you got to have batteries, a massive, massive number of batteries."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 510, "phrase": "Yeah, it’s hard to measure in direct impact, but it’s an experiment that we shouldn’t be performing. And the sooner we can end the experiment the sooner we can kind of move on in a fully sustainable way that is actually lower cost. I think the thing that people haven’t fully internalized is once we do get to the 25K car, the ownership cost of that car is incredibly lower than the prior car. And then on the solar side and wind, with the cost of solar wind coming down and with batteries coming down with them, the actual cost of energy on the grid is going down. So we’re sort of moving towards a sustainable lower cost future. So there’s not like a sacrifice."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 512, "phrase": "That’s true. It is a false dichotomy to say that it’s either prosperity or sustainability. This is often used by oil and gas to say like, “Oh, well, do you want people to lose their jobs? Do you want to lower people’s standards of living? Do you want to make all these economic sacrifices really in order to have sustainability?” And the reality, as Drew was saying, is that sustainable energy is going to be lower cost, not higher cost than fossil fuels."}, {"author": "Speaker 7", "serial_number": 514, "phrase": "Elon, quick question for you, right here in front. First, thanks for having everyone. I was telling a friend, the one company to go work for that’s going to have the biggest structural…"}, {"author": "Speaker 8", "serial_number": 516, "phrase": "And the one company to go work for, that’s going to have the biggest structural impact over the next 10 years at scale, it’s probably Tesla. So kudos to everyone at Tesla for what they’ve done to this point and going forward. The two questions for you, as you’ve looked at the auto in the storage markets, I know you’ve talked about it at kind of 50/50 longterm, but it seems like a lot of the battery cost curve achievements that you presented today, really make some of these storage opportunities much more feasible over the next five years. And so I guess the first part of the question is, does your calculus upon learning and improving these things, change on that 50/50 mix, or is there a role where storage becomes bigger? And then the second part of the question, with all these huge grand visions, who’s going to be with Tesla from a corporate perspective, accomplishing these things? Obviously, Tesla can’t do it alone, but when you look at some of the traditional auto industry or power, et cetera, I don’t see a lot of other Tesla’s."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 518, "phrase": "Well actually, there’s a lot of companies in China that I think are doing great work with electric vehicles and also with stationary storage, although we don’t see that much in the US yet, but I think probably we will in the future. I don’t know, obviously we’re doing everything we can to encourage other companies to move to sustainable transport and also make stationary storage batteries. We made our patents freely available, we really try to tell these companies, “Hey, you really need to do this, or you won’t exist in the future,” but they don’t believe it. So we’ve talked until we’re blue in the face. What are we supposed to do? But we really are hopeful that other companies will also do what we’re doing and that will make a sustainable future come sooner."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 520, "phrase": "From a fundamental market size perspective, we did the first ground up work to show the size of the market in terawatt hours and they are roughly 50/50. 10 terawatt hours for transportation, 10 terawatt hours for the grid. And part of that is because the grid batteries, because when you’re making a power plant, you’re making a large investment, our 25-year assets are greater. If the grid batteries were 10-year kind of things, the grid market would be bigger, but because it’s a longer duration asset, they’re roughly the same size."}, {"author": "Speaker 9", "serial_number": 522, "phrase": "Thinking long-term, is there any other segments that this new battery will be able to disrupt or electrify, beyond just the initial Model 2 or cheaper sedan?

Right here."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 528, "phrase": "Okay, great. It’s like ventriloquism here, we just get the sound out of the speaker and can’t tell where the heck it’s coming from."}, {"author": "Speaker 9", "serial_number": 530, "phrase": "Yeah. Any hints or is the model too such a big deal because it decreases the cost of transportation, that that is really the disruption, or should we get hyped that this new cost curve opens up different vehicle categories, like a high passenger density bus, Boring loop, boat, plane?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 532, "phrase": "Well, I mean, there are batteries in limited production right now, that do exceed 400 watt hours per kilogram, which I think is about the number you need for a decent range, medium range aircraft. And I think our batteries will, over time, start to approach the 400 watt hours per kilogram range as well. So yeah, I mean, I think over time, we’ll see all modes of transport, with the ironic exception of rockets, transition to sustainability or to electric basically. On the rocket front, what we’re planning to do is, about 80% of Starship is liquid oxygen and we’re actually already running a power line to be able to use wind power to create the liquid oxygen. So we’re making some decent progress on sustainability on the rocket front, but there’s just no way to have an electric rocket. And it’s important for the future of life and consciousness, that we become a multi planet species, so got to keep doing that."}, {"author": "Josh Phillips", "serial_number": 534, "phrase": "Hi Elon, Josh Phillips here, retail investor. I have a question in regards to the lithium and nickel industries and the likely price spikes and shortages of high grade materials the EV industry is likely to see if they don’t act fast to address future supply. Tesla have clearly made the right moves that are necessary, but there’s a real worry that the potential supply issues and price spikes will create a drag on the rest of the EV industry and therefore a drag on global EV adoption. What advice would you give to the EV and mining industries to quickly solve this looming hurdle? Because for a sustainable energy future, the spice must flow. Thank you."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 536, "phrase": "Yeah, indeed. The spice must flow. The new spice. I don’t know. I’m not sure. I guess we can try to basically overdo it in cell production and perhaps supply cells to others, but we do see the fundamental constraint, as total cell production. That’s why we’re putting so much effort into making cells and kind of trying to reinvent every aspect of cell production, from mining the ore, to a complete battery pack, because it’s the fundamental constraint. We’re not getting into the cell business just for the hell of it, it’s because it’s the fundamental constraint, it’s the thing that is the limiting factor for rapid growth. But we could certainly try to overdo it on cell production and perhaps sell cells to others, although we are going at absolute top speed, so it’s not like we’re holding it back."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 538, "phrase": "I think just making really efficient cars that have lower drag coefficient, low rolling resistance, efficient powertrains, I mean, that’s kind of what we’ve done in order to make iron phosphate still have a good range. So the iron phosphate’s a lower energy density solution, but while there are some limitations on the total amount of nickel produced every year, there’s really no limit on the iron. There’s so much iron it’s ridiculous. So you can really scale up iron phosphate at a raw materials basis, more than you can nickel."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 540, "phrase": "And just to point out, when we were walking through this presentation, we intentionally separated all the different aspects. The benefits of structural battery, apply to an iron based cathode in the same way they apply to a nickel based cathode. So you get longer range, iron base vehicles. And also the silicon benefit can apply to the iron based vehicles as well. So we can do a lot to extend the range of an iron based vehicle, which is why it’s a key part of the roadmap going forward. And then I invited Turner up here to talk about what the mining industry can do."}, {"author": "Turner", "serial_number": 542, "phrase": "Yeah. Diversification on the cathode side, is obviously massive and EVs are all about efficiency. And so for the EV industry, for the vehicle industry, we need to see powertrain efficiency really increase, all other companies, matching Tesla powertrain efficiency, so that everyone can have that diversified cathode approach, where LFP is used in medium range, and even really make a 300 mile vehicle with LFP. And really the goal that we were trying to present here, was a model for vertical integration, strategic vertical integration, that a lot of different people can do. What we need to see is vertical integration that shortens the process path, from mine to cathode. And what we’re doing here is novel and we’re trying to push the industry in that direction. So we’re presenting a model here that anyone can can follow."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 544, "phrase": "Yeah. In fact, if there’s anything that you guys want to comment on, feel free to step forward and say something."}, {"author": "Speaker 10", "serial_number": 546, "phrase": "I think the key is to be smart about your chemistry choices, your materials choices."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 548, "phrase": "Talk louder."}, {"author": "Speaker 10", "serial_number": 550, "phrase": "Yeah. If you’re smart about your materials choices, the spice will continue to flow. You don’t need to use the same kind everywhere.

And actually we had good calls, they’re all motivated. I think, they’ve been sort of sitting back being like, “Are you going to grow like crazy?” And we’re like, “Yeah, we’re going to grow like crazy.” And then I think this indicates we’re going to grow like crazy and that’s what the miners want to hear and then they’ll go make the investments."}, {"author": "Ben Limpic", "serial_number": 554, "phrase": "Hello, Elon. This is Ben Limpic, I’m a musician. I was wondering, does Tesla have any future plans to make partnerships with music companies, like it has done with Tencent games or things like that, for you guys to actually kind of expand your services for artists and other types of creative people, to get involved in producing content that can be part of the Tesla ecosystem or so other people that do creative things can get involved with you guys?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 556, "phrase": "We haven’t really thought about it that much, but I suppose it’s probably something we should think about. We will be providing a title on the Tesla’s. So we’re providing more music sources that people can choose from and just generally trying to improve the entertainment experience in the cars. And I think actually as we go to a more autonomous future, the importance of entertainment and productivity will become greater and greater. I mean, to the degree that if you’re just basically sitting in your car, the car is fully autonomous and driving somewhere, the car is essentially your chauffeur and then the things that become important are, okay, well let’s have good entertainment and if you want to do some productivity stuff, then that actually starts to become much more important because you’re no longer spending your attention driving the car. So it will be extremely important in the future."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 558, "phrase": "Should we do some of the say.com questions?"}, {"author": "Speaker 11", "serial_number": 560, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 562, "phrase": "Okay. Should we do the second one?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 564, "phrase": "Yeah. The first one, I think we already answered. If we’re able to make enough cells, which we’ll try to do, we will supply other companies. It’s definitely not an intentional effort to keep the cells to ourselves, if we can make enough for other companies, we will supply them. And we were trying to do the right thing for advancing the sustainable energy, whatever that is."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 566, "phrase": "Vehicle to grid, we get asked that a lot. I think one of the things that’s important to note, is vehicle to grid, unless you have a power cutoff, you need to cut off your main supply to the grid, otherwise, if you lose the power in your house, you’ll basically just backflow energy to the grid. So just having a reversal in the power flow, does not actually keep the lights on, you need a whole separate system to cut off power to the grid. And I think there’s also the case that people really want the freedom to be able to drive and to charge at their house. And it’s obviously very problematic if you get to morning and your car, instead of being charged, it discharged into the house and then you’re sort of, “Okay, now I can either drive or use the battery to power my house.”"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 568, "phrase": "I think it’s actually going to be better for people’s freedom of action, to have a power wall and a car separate, and then everything works that. You basically combine that with solar, either solar retrofit or solar glass roof, and local battery storage, so you basically become your own utility and then the car can be charged also with solar. I think that’s the stuff that works, that said, we can certainly do vehicle to grid, I think we can basically enable that with software in Europe or something, right?"}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 570, "phrase": "Yeah. Future generations of power electronics, we will be able to do this more or less everywhere, from a energy market participation perspective, but from a backing up the house and it just so happens that the way the North American connectors are, on all the cars in North America, it doesn’t matter whether it’s the Tesla connector or the connector that the other vehicles have, doesn’t actually support powering your home. It’s unfortunate, so you’d need an additional hardware to do that. But yeah, in the future, all versions of our vehicles will be able to at least do bi-directional power flow for the purposes of energy market participation. But even for that, it’s important to remember that your car is in plugged in 24/7, so it’s kind of an unpredictable resource for the grid. It’ll have a value, but it’s not the same as a stationary battery pack."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 572, "phrase": "Yeah. Honestly, a vehicle to grid sounds good, but I think actually has a much lower utility than people think. I think very few people would actually use vehicle to grid. With the original roadster, we had vehicle to grid capabilities, nobody used it."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 574, "phrase": "How do we find the engineers to do everything we’re saying?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 576, "phrase": "How do we find the engineers to do all these things? Well, I guess we recruit a lot of engineers from all parts of the world. I think Tesla has a good reputation for doing exciting engineering and that tends to attract a lot of the top engineers in the world because they know that their efforts at Tesla will really serve the greater good and we’re super hardcore about engineering. Tesla is first and foremost an engineering company, it’s like hardcore engineering is what we do. The sheer amount of hardcore engineering done at Tesla is insane. And if you look at say, there’s various surveys done of engineering schools, where do you want to go, what’s your top choices? And actually the top two choices last few years, have been Tesla and SpaceX. So sometimes it’s Tesla first and sometimes SpaceX first, but those are the two top ones."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 578, "phrase": "Yeah.

And like you said, the battle is far from over. Less than 1% of the global automotive fleet has been converted to electric and even maybe less than 0.1% of stationary storage has been done. So stationary storage has barely begun, converting the global vehicle fleet to electric, has barely begun. So there’s still a massive amount of engineering work to be done at Tesla and other companies, to accelerate this transition to sustainability."}, {"author": "Jordan", "serial_number": 582, "phrase": "Hey, can you guys hear me?"}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 584, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Jordan", "serial_number": 586, "phrase": "This is Jordan from Mark Asset Management. So you’ve talked about the importance of the factory and you’ve mentioned the ground up design process and a lot of the new things that you’re going to be doing or started to do in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin. Can you just maybe help us understand and quantify, how financially meaningful all of those improvements will be, and then given what you’re trying to accomplish as a company, is it fair to assume that the vast majority of improvement will be given back to the customer in the form of lower prices?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 588, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, I think certainly we will try to give back as much as possible to the customers. It’s not like Tesla’s profitability is crazy high, our average profitability for last four quarters, is maybe 1%. So just to be clear, it’s not like we’re minting money. Our evaluation makes it seem like we are, but we’re not. So we do want to try to make the price as competitive as we can, without losing money. If you keep losing money, you’ll just die. So this thing called profit is just like, we need to bring in more money than we spend, otherwise we’re dead."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 590, "phrase": "But affordability is key to how we scale, right? The demand goes non-linear as you reduce the price of the car."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 592, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, it’s important to sort of separate the difference between affordability and value for money or desirability of the product. So for a lot of people, they want to buy a Tesla, they simply don’t have enough money. We could make the car infinitely desirable, but if somebody does not have enough money, they can’t buy it. Sometimes people kind of forget this. People have to have enough money to buy the car and just making a car super desirable, but expensive, does not mean they can afford it. So it’s absolutely critical that we make cars that people can actually afford. Go through some of these things, scroll down or something."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 594, "phrase": "When do you expect Tesla vehicles to beat ICE vehicles on initial purchase price? I think a way to answer that question, is in the classes of vehicles we sell today, we’re already doing that."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 596, "phrase": "Yeah. We’re already pretty close. And then factoring in total cost of ownership and the fact that electric vehicles require much less servicing and are way cheaper to run, when you look at total cost of ownership. And you can always lease a car, so if you just lease a car or get a loan for a car, you’ve got your sort of monthly payments and then your cost for either gasoline or electricity and your cost of servicing and the fully considered cost of electric car is much less than a gasoline car of the same nominal purchase price. I mean, that said, maybe on the order of three years, when we can do lower cost, like a $25,000 car, I think that will be basically on par, maybe slightly better than a comparable gasoline car. So I think maybe it’s on the order of three years-ish."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 598, "phrase": "How have the technology advancements and increased vertical integration of battery manufacturing, influenced your ability to improve the environmental and social impact of the supply chain?

How are you going to address the cathode durability and cost and environmental impact trifecta? Is this something you’re going to leave the environment upstream and supply chain to solve? No, I think we tried to answer that directly. I mean, we really are looking at not just what happens in the cathode facility, but currently outside the cathode facility that should really be inside and removing processes that shouldn’t have been there in the first place and the use of reagents that are just costly and not necessary and removing a bunch of wastewater from the process."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 620, "phrase": "Guys, is there anything you want to add to … Maybe we can go through everyone and maybe say what you’re doing and say a few words.

We are really advancing the materials manufacturing for cathodes and for lithium, beyond what has been accomplished in the previous 20 years."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 652, "phrase": "It’s exciting."}, {"author": "Turner", "serial_number": 654, "phrase": "Yeah. My name is Turner, work closely with the team, have worked a lot with everyone here. On the cathode and upstream materials side, it’s really important that everyone understand that this growth is coming. This growth is real, we are going to make all of these batteries and everyone needs to grow with us, the entire supply chain needs to grow with us. And if you have an idea that simplifies anything in the supply chain, come talk to us, come work with us and let’s do it."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 656, "phrase": "Any existing specification is wrong, any existing manufacturing method is wrong, process equipment, it’s wrong, it’s just a question of how wrong.

Trying to be less wrong."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 660, "phrase": "So tell us how we’re wrong and how we can do it better, so that we can accelerate and improve as fast as possible."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 662, "phrase": "All right. Well, I guess thank you everyone for coming. I hope you liked the presentation. Very exciting future ahead. We’re going to work our damnedest to transition the world to sustainable energy as quickly as possible, and your support and help is key to that success.

{"title": "Tesla (TSLA) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript: Announce Austin Gigafactory, Beat Forecasts", "url": "https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/tesla-tsla-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript-announce-austin-gigafactory-beat-forecasts", "replicas": [{"author": "Martin Eberhard", "serial_number": 0, "phrase": "Elon?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 2, "phrase": "Thank you. First of all, I’d like to thank the Tesla team for exceptional execution in the second quarter. Despite tremendous difficulties, they’ve done an incredible job and it’s an honor to work with such a great team. I mean, there were so many challenges, too numerous to name, but they got it done. And it just what a great group to work with. Like I said, it’s just an honor to work such a great team. So as a result, we were able to achieve a fourth consecutive profitable quarter. And although the automotive industry was down about 30% year over year in the first half of the year, we managed to grow deliveries in the first half of the year. So despite that massive industry decline, we actually went up."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 4, "phrase": "We’re also very excited to announce that we’re going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas. It’s going to be a right near Austin. It’ll be about … I’ll go into better detail on this and I’m sure there will be a lot of questions. But the location is five minutes from Austin International Airport and 15 minutes from downtown Austin. It’s about 2000 acres and we’re going to make it a factory that it’s going to be stunning. It’s right on the Colorado River. So we’re going to have a boardwalk where there’ll be a hiking, biking trail. It’s going to basically be an ecological paradise. Birds in the trees, butterflies, fish in the stream. And it will be open to the public as well so not closed and only Tesla. So if anyone’s interested in working at Giga Texas, engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please let us know. We’re going to be doing a major, major factory there. And it’s also where we’ll be doing cyber truck there, the Tesla semi, and we’ll be doing Model 3 and Y for the Eastern half of North America."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 6, "phrase": "Now at the same time, I want to say we will continue to grow in California, but we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the Western half of North America. And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also makes sense in California. So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California and just emphasize we’ll continue to grow in California, but we’ll be creating a massive factory and cyber truck and semi programs in Texas. And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, economic development team and the Governor, really I was super impressed. The Tesla team was super impressed, and we will for sure strongly consider Tulsa for a future expansion of Tesla down the road. Let’s see. Is there anything more you want to say about? This is a lot of information, so. Anything else, guys? All right. Well, I’m sure there will be lots of questions. We’ve already started work on the facility so some initial construction work it’s already underway out of this weekend."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 8, "phrase": "Let’s see. Moving on to other subjects. Solar, we recently adjusted the pricing about retrofit solar. So Tesla solar is the lowest cost solar in the United States. And we added a lowest cost guarantee and a money back guarantee. So we’re very confident that people will love our solar product, whether it’s this whole retrofit or solar roof. Our solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average. After the federal tax credit, Tesla Solar now costs $1.49 per watt, and it’s a very simple, highly automated single click experience. So definitely think about a Tesla, whether you want a new roof, Tesla solar roof, or you want solar on your existing roof. Either way, we’re the company to go to."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 10, "phrase": "And then you can also get a power wall and have energy independence and be your own utility. So I think that product is really coming together and it’s only going to get better later this year. So just very excited about that business potential. On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car with more than 400 miles range. So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA certified range of 402 miles. I mean, basically you can drive from LA to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over when you arrived and this was at highway speeds. So you don’t have to do anything, drive slowly or anything. You just drive it. You can just drive normally and go very long distances."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 12, "phrase": "And then for full self driving, we launched traffic lights and stop signs, and we’re continuing to improve that to make them more robust. And we’re currently testing also driving software for intersections and city streets and narrow streets. So I personally test the latest [inaudible 00:05:54] of full self driving software when I drive my car. And it is really, I think, profoundly better than people realize. Yeah, really profoundly better. It’s amazing. So it’s almost getting to the point where I can go from my house to work with no interventions, despite going through construction and widely varying situations. So this is why I am very confident about full self driving, the functionality being complete by the end of this year, because I’m literally driving it."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 14, "phrase": "In conclusion, I’d like to again say thanks for all the hard work of the Tesla team achieving our first four year of profitability in the company history. It was incredibly difficult and just as a result of the hard work of a lot of people from Tesla worldwide. And yeah, just think about the next 12 to 18 months, we’ll have three new factories in place. Things are looking great with a Giga Berlin and we’ll have cyber truck, semi, Roadster, full self driving. There’s so much to be excited about. It’s really hard to kind of put into this call, but the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the autonomy and the manufacturing engineering front is mindblowing."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 16, "phrase": "And then of course, there’s [inaudible 00:07:40] Day, which is coming up pretty soon. And I think that’s really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see. So with that, thanks again for your support in our long term mission. And we’re looking forward to having a great journey with you to create amazing products and continue scaling it. And yeah, I think I’ve never been more optimistic or excited about the future of Tesla and then the history of the company. Thank you."}, {"author": "Martin Eberhard", "serial_number": 18, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And I think our CFO Zachary Kirkhorn has some remarks as well."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 20, "phrase": "Yeah. Thanks, Martin. I want to start by thanking our employees, customers, and suppliers for your support over the last quarter. In particular to the Tesla team. I couldn’t be more impressed with the hard work and the resiliency that you all have shown. In net income overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability. This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and field operations around the world. To ensure the business remained healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to personnel and noncritical path projects. The direct cost savings or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost savings actions although the costs were concentrated in cogs and the cost reductions were on both cogs and operating expenses."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 22, "phrase": "On automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, this reduced sequentially from 20% to 18.7%. This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency due to the various shutdowns. Despite these charges, we continue to make progress reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai. Given the global macro economic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass through savings to customers around the world on some of our products. With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized 48 million of deferred revenue in the period. The full profit impact on our P&L is less than half of this due to cost associated with FSD computer retrofits in the field. Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to 428 million. While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is roughly double that of 2019 services."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 24, "phrase": "Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement. In the energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit. We remain production constrained in this business and are continuing to work towards building additional capacity. And our solar installation business was impacted by permit office closures, limiting installation volume. Stock-based comp increased from Q1 to Q2. This is driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next traunch of the CEO grant, as well as early vesting of the first traunch, which is reflected in SGNA within operating expenses. On cashflows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of 8.6 billion, which included free cash flows of over 400 million. This is a strong result on its own, despite an increase in capital expenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin, as well as movements in working capital."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 26, "phrase": "A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables. While our AR balance is usually about 20% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors. First, overall less than 30% of our receivables is associated with new car sales. Second, due to payment terms associated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement timelines for certain methods of cash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivables are impacted significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of the quarter. Third, roughly 40% of the balance is attributed payment terms on regulatory credit sales and statutory incentive programs, both of which have been increasing. Customer deposits reduced slightly as well. Note that as we transitioned to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to reduce, driving down this balance. As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture. We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital management. This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations, and preparing for the launch of three new factories over the next year and a half."}, {"author": "Martin Eberhard", "serial_number": 28, "phrase": "Thank you very much. Let’s go to questions from institutional investors first. The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the longterm goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years beyond Model 3, Y and the cyber truck? Cheaper, smaller versions of 3 and Y or region specific vehicles or anything else?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 30, "phrase": "Well, I don’t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what’s announced because I think we want to reserve that for product launches. It would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher capacity passenger vehicle of some kind. These are likely things at some point, but I do think there’s a long way to go with 3 and Y and with cyber truck and semi. It’s a long way to go with those. I think we’ll do the obvious things."}, {"author": "Martin Eberhard", "serial_number": 32, "phrase": "Okay. The second question from institutional is, what is your vision for self-drive Tesla? What opportunities do you see for monetizing the installed base other than by FST?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 34, "phrase": "Right now I thought FST as just overwhelmingly the most important thing. I think the upgrading of the fleet to full self driving, especially with an over the air software update, may go down as the biggest asset value increase in history as a step change. Maybe there’s something bigger, but it certainly would be one of the biggest. I can’t think of anything bigger. So overnight, a million depending exactly when it happens and when it’s allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 36, "phrase": "… regulatory jurisdictions you’d have like, I don’t know, at least a few million cars suddenly becoming five times more valuable or something like that. So like five times higher utility to go from like 12 hours a week of utility, something like that. That’s how many hours they used, 260, something like that. Everything else is pretty small by comparison. Now, when things do become full self-driving, so what are people going to do in the car? Well, I guess they’re probably going to do productivity and entertainment of some kind, watch movies, play games, and do work. That’s in the future. We’re already putting some games and stuff on the car just for fun."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 38, "phrase": "Yeah. We have been experimenting on that. FSD remains by far and away the biggest opportunity in the near term, but we’re putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale other areas when the time is right. So premium connectivity subscription is something that we put in place and the ability to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on acceleration boost or upgrading a standard range Model 3 to a Standard Plus, adding rear heated seats. These are things that we have, and we’re continuing to get feedback from the field on other things that we can launch, and we’ll trickle those in with time."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 40, "phrase": "Yeah. But they’re all very tiny compared with… The step change to full self driving depending upon high calculated is probably worth at least a hundred thousand dollars per car. That’s a lot of software you have to sell in the app store or whatever."}, {"author": "Moderator", "serial_number": 42, "phrase": "Thank you. The third question is also about autopilot. What are the most important upcoming self-driving milestones, and how do you think about timing?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 44, "phrase": "Well, the actual major milestone that’s happening right now is really transition of the autonomy system of the cars like AI, if you will, from thinking about things in like two and a half D. It’s basically taking isolated pictures and doing image recognition on pictures that are partially correlated in time but not very well. And transitioning to kind of a 4D, which is video essentially. You’re thinking about the world in three dimensions and the fourth dimension being time. So that architectural change, which has been underway for some time but has not really been rolled out to anyone in the production fleet is what really matters for full self driving."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 46, "phrase": "What we’ve been doing thus far is really just going with 2D, mostly 2D, and like I said, not well correlated in time. So it’s just hard to convey just how much better a fully 4D system does work. It’s capable of things that if you’re just looking at things as individual pictures as opposed to video, basically you go from like individual pictures to a surround video. This is fundamental. The car will seem to have just like a giant improvement. We’ll probably roll it out later this year, but be able to do your traffic lights, stop, turns, everything pretty much."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 48, "phrase": "Then it will be a long March of Nines, essentially. How many nines of reliability are okay? So it’s definitely way better than human, but how much better than human does it need to be? That’s actually going to be the real work. There’s just a massive amount of work with each kind of order of magnitude of reliability. You’ll see a [inaudible 00:20:12] happen and if you plot the points on a curve, it’ll be kind of obvious where it’s headed. AI in general, I think is something… I’ve been banging this AI drum for a decade, we should be concerned about where AI is going. The people I see being the most wrong about AI are the ones who are very smart because they can’t imagine that a computer could be way smarter than them. That’s the flow in their logic. They’re just way dumber than they think they are."}, {"author": "Moderator", "serial_number": 50, "phrase": "Thank you. The next question from this additional investor is, please may you update us on alien dreadnought? How has your thinking evolved, and what is needed in order to get closer to fundamental physical limits?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 52, "phrase": "A massive amount of effort into manufacturing engineering, the machine that makes the machine is probably a 1000%, maybe 10000% more engineering required for the factory than for the product itself. So we’re certainly making progress. I mean, battery and powertrain Gigafactory in Nevada is on an alien dreadnought version 0.5, something like that. Starting to approach version one. We’re getting way better at making cars. You can see that in Giga Shanghai. You’ll see that even more with Berlin and we’re really changing the design of the car in order to make it more manufacturable. The fundamental architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin. It may look the same, but the internals will be quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturally than what we’ve done to date. Drew, would you like to add to that?"}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 54, "phrase": "Yeah, I was going to expand on that thought. I think part of the alien dreadnought concept is not just automation, but minimizing the number of process steps and complexity involved in the manufacturing system, which involves really integrating design and manufacturing across when the raw materials enter the factory to the finished goods exit. We’re learning so much through doing that."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 56, "phrase": "Yeah. Vertical integration is extremely important for this. But the supply chain, if you put a GPS tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable product, it would look insane. It would be like, wow, it went around the world like six times. With vertical integration, maybe you can only go around the world once. It’s a huge improvement. I think if we could get vertical integration, we could probably get you an order magnitude improvement. Yeah. [inaudible 00:08:29]."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 58, "phrase": "Yeah. I think the focus for us is increasing CapEx efficiency. This is something that we’ve been working very hard for the past three years. You can see that we can build new factories for less amount of money and much faster."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 60, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 62, "phrase": "Those things work together."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 64, "phrase": "It’s a better factory for less money and less time."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 66, "phrase": "Yeah, less money means less time. So that’s a great advantage. We’re also reducing, and this still is a lot, the amount of inefficiencies. We want every operation to add value to the vehicle, value meaning moving the atoms closer to the final state. So we do not want any robot that just moves things."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 68, "phrase": "Yes. [crosstalk 00:09:21]. In fact, it’s like we want to be super respectful of people’s labor. If we’re asking somebody to do something, are we sure it’s useful? Are we asking them to spend their time in a way that is respectful of their time? But it’s like, wow, the potential for improvement is just tremendous. I just want to be clear, here at Tesla, we love manufacturing. It’s awesome. I really think more smart people should be working on manufacturing. It’s like-"}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 70, "phrase": "We want more people."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 72, "phrase": "Yes. We love it. We do."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 74, "phrase": "If people are interested in designing new lines and trying to do things different, Tesla has got a job for you. Now we’ve got jobs everywhere. It’s not only in California. We got jobs in China, in Berlin, in Austin, Texas, and in California. So there’s plenty of exciting places and all these places will do original work and challenging and meaningful work."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 76, "phrase": "Absolutely. It’s actually extremely exciting and fulfilling to design new production systems. I think that for some reason I kind of got a bad rap, especially in the US for a long time. I think people don’t think that manufacture… They thought of manufacturing as like, “Oh, it’s just some boring, just making copies or whatever.” But actually there’s far more opportunity for innovation in manufacturing than in the product itself. Order magnitude. If there’s one thing that comes out of this call, it’s like, “Hey, if you want to help us invent amazing manufacturing techniques and have them put into the product itself.” It’s not like you just get tossed the product and say, “Hey, make this product.” And it’s kind of a lousy design. If you’re a manufacturer, you get to change the product design and say, “Hey, this product you’re asking me to manufacturer is dumb.” They’re like, “Great, let’s fix it.”"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 78, "phrase": "So at Tesla, if you work on manufacturing and engineering, you don’t just get forced [inaudible 00:11:28]. You get to change the product design. So it’s super exciting. And we evolved [Alliance 00:26:37] even after their book, this rapid evolution of the production system."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 80, "phrase": "And there’s nothing more rewarding than going from zero cars an hour to 5,000 cars a week or a thousand cars a day."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 82, "phrase": "Yeah. So the long term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think will be manufacturing."}, {"author": "Moderator", "serial_number": 84, "phrase": "Thank you very much. The last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 86, "phrase": "Well, right now, zero. But longterm, a lot."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 88, "phrase": "Our biggest property."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 90, "phrase": "Yeah. It’s the biggest property. True."}, {"author": "Moderator", "serial_number": 92, "phrase": "Okay. Now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com. The first one is, Tesla energy seems widely ignored by Wall Street despite Elon’s comments about growth rate exceeding automotive. Could Tesla share more detail on current their plan projects to help investors better understand the business outlook? How disruptive is this Autobidder technology?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 94, "phrase": "Yeah, I can’t emphasize enough. I think long term, Tesla energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla automotive. I mean the energy business collectively is bigger than the automotive business. So you say like, how big is the energy sector? Bigger than automotive. In order to achieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think is going to be primarily solar and by wind and those are intermittent. So you need to have a lot of batteries to store the energy because the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine. There’s like three elements of the sustainable energy future, wind and solar, sustainable energy generation, battery storage, and electric transport. Those three things. The mission of Tesla is to accelerate sustainable energy. I can’t emphasize enough the… Yeah. Battery and solar will both be enormous and they kind of have to be in order for us to have a sustainable future. We’ve got a great product roadmap on that front as well. [inaudible 00:29:09] the Megapack is very well received. Yeah, if you want to talk about that."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 96, "phrase": "Yeah. I think the Megapack has represented itself and is an integrated rapidly deployable grid type storage battery of megawatt hour scale. We’re working with utilities large and small, not just utilities, but also just micro grid and project developers of all types and building our own projects where it makes sense. There’s a lot of demand for the product and we’re growing the production rates as fast as we can for that product. Then on Autobidder, Autobidder is basically autopilot for grid tied batteries. It’s an autonomous energy market participation system that does high frequency trading and ensures-"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 98, "phrase": "That’s a bad word."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 100, "phrase": "Sorry. Sorry."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 102, "phrase": "… frequency trading-"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 104, "phrase": "That’s a bad word."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 106, "phrase": "Sorry, sorry."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 108, "phrase": "High frequency trading should be called front running. We’re not doing that."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 110, "phrase": "We’re not doing anything like that. No, it’s ensuring that the battery is doing everything it can to manage the [crosstalk 00:30:12] of the renewables, and just grid intermittency of all kinds. I mean, people turn their lights on and off. Power plants turn on and off. Factories ramp up and down, and batteries are great to solve those problems."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 112, "phrase": "Yeah, it’s just grid stabilization at the millisecond level."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 114, "phrase": "Exactly."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 116, "phrase": "So it just ensures that things are super smooth. It’s like UPS, an uninterruptible power supply, of a normal size. But just ensures that the grid has smooth sailing, and the batteries, the computers won’t interact with each other, and make sure that they’re working together to make the grid as smooth. And this can be done with the Power Walls and the Megapacks and the Power Packs all working together, and interacting with third party systems as well."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 118, "phrase": "Yeah, centrally or distributed, it does both."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 120, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 122, "phrase": "Yeah, I mean, yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 124, "phrase": "It’s necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 126, "phrase": "Yeah, you can’t plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world. You need to optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale and that’s what we’re doing."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 128, "phrase": "Yeah, the real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. That’s a real limit. So, that’s where… We can talk a little more about this on Battery Day, because this is the fundamental scaling constraint. And any part of that supply chain or processing at the cell level will be the limiting factor. So, whatever it may be, anywhere from mining to refining. There’s many steps, in refining, to cathode and anode formation, cell formation, whatever the trouble point is, that will set the growth rate."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 130, "phrase": "And so, we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others. And there’s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 132, "phrase": "Thank you. The second question is, now that it’s time to bring the Tesla semi to volume production, can you share more detail on production plans? What weekly production rate is considered volume production, and when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?"}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 134, "phrase": "Yeah, so we’ll start production next year as we announce before. I personally very care about the project. I can’t wait. We do have a few trucks that keep driving around, and keep delivering cars. But we’re going to accelerate that. I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use ourselves at Tesla to carry our own freight. Probably mostly between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route. We’re going to prove that we have really good reliability."}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 136, "phrase": "So far the early units do have it, but we’ll develop them larger scale. And we have also promised some early units to some long term, very patient and supportive customers, and we’ll do that. And we will have more sales coming up in next year, as Elon just pointed out. So we can increase the diversity of the portfolio."}, {"author": "Speaker 5", "serial_number": 138, "phrase": "It didn’t make sense up to now to do it, but we’ll be ready, and that’s… Maybe a little biased, but I’m very excited about this. We have a lot of very unique technology that we’re always dreaming about that we will be putting in to that semi. It will be just awesome."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 140, "phrase": "Yeah. And just, there’s two general classes of cell. There’s iron phosphate and then the nickel-based. The nickel-based cells have higher energy density, so longer range. Obviously those are needed for something like the semi, where every unit of mass that you add in battery pack you have to subtract in cargo."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 142, "phrase": "So it’s very important to have mass-efficient and long range pack for batteries. However, what we’re seeing with our passenger vehicles is our power train efficiency, tire efficiency, drag coefficient… If all of the things, HVAC, going into a heat pump, [inaudible 00:34:55] our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 in China. And that’ll be in volume production later this year."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 144, "phrase": "So we think that getting a range that is in the high 200’s… Basically, but we think, probably get a range of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into a whole bunch of power train and other vehicle efficiencies. And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and other projects that require higher energy density. So, yeah, [inaudible 00:35:49] two supply chains that you can tap into, iron phosphate or nickel."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 146, "phrase": "We use very little cobalt in our system already, and that may trend to zero [inaudible 00:36:03]. So it’s really about nickel."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 148, "phrase": "Thank you. And the next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce standard range version of Model Y. No longer offers a standard range S or X, and has announced ramping of the semi. Does this shift from smaller pack vehicle suggest that Tesla is not battery-constrained as in the past? What are the biggest constraints now?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 150, "phrase": "Well, I’d just like to re-emphasize [inaudible 00:36:32], any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay? Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel, and don’t wait for nickel to go back to some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficient, as environmentally friendly nickel mining, at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way. So, hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 152, "phrase": "With regard to passenger vehicles, I think the new normal for range is going to be, just in U.S. EPA terms, approximately 300 miles. So I think people will really come to expect that, as some number close to 300 miles, as normal. That’s a standard expectation."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 154, "phrase": "Because you do need to take into account, is it very hot outside? Or very cold? Or are you driving up a tall mountain with a full load? And it’s… People don’t want to get to a destination with like 10 miles range. They want some reasonable margin."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 156, "phrase": "So, I think 300 is going to be really… or close to 300 is going to be a new normal. Call it 500 kilometers, basically. Roughly."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 158, "phrase": "Thank you. The next question on insurance. What is the holdup on Tesla Insurance outside of California? Will you release numbers from that part of the business? Will Tesla Insurance be required to participate in the Tesla ride hailing network as a driver?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 160, "phrase": "Sure."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 162, "phrase": "Yeah. We were joking before the call that we get the quarterly insurance question that pops up on [inaudible 00:38:44] dot com here. We are working super hard on insurance. I’ll go into a little bit more detail than I have in the past."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 164, "phrase": "Currently, we have a product in California, as I’ve described before, it’s been quite well received. And I would largely describe it as a fairly standard insurance product with elements of it that are unique to our cars. So you can think of it as a Version 1 of Tesla Insurance."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 166, "phrase": "Version 0.9 [inaudible 00:39:13] at least."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 168, "phrase": "0.9. But what we’re working on now is, we can call it Version 2 or the first version of our telematics product. And so really, ultimately where we want to get to with Tesla Insurance is to be able to use the data that’s captured in the car, in the driving profile of the person in the car, to be able to assess correlations and probabilities of crash, and to be able, then, to assess a premium on a monthly basis for that customer."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 170, "phrase": "And what makes this very exciting for us is, the amount of data that is available with the customer’s permission to use, is not available in any other product or any other vehicle in the world. So this gives us a unique advantage in terms of information."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 172, "phrase": "And we had a decision point here, where we could take the California product and replicate that into other states, or we could delay going into additional states, and instead put more effort into the telematics side of this. And we chose the latter. And where we are now is, nearly complete with the risk and cost analysis associated with the first version of the telematics product. We hope to be filing that in a handful of states, with regulators, very shortly."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 174, "phrase": "And assuming that regulatory approvals go smoothly, we hope to have this in a handful of states by the end of the year. And then we’ll continue to file for approval in additional states. With regulatory approval there, we’ll continue to roll this out nationwide as quickly as we can."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 176, "phrase": "And then that product, as we continue to collect more data, and we iterate on it, there will be Version 2, Version 3, et cetera, as we continue to refine that."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 178, "phrase": "Yeah, I mean, at the heart of being competitive with insurance is, what is the accuracy of your information? Are you dealing with… Are you forced to assess people statistically, looking in the rear view mirror? Or can you assess people individually, looking ahead with smart projections? And inform the driver of how they may reduce their… what actions they can take to reduce their insurance, as Zack was alluding to. It’s like, okay, you’re driving too fast. You’re doing this or that or the other thing. It’s like, if you want to pay more for insurance you can, but if you want to pay less, then please don’t drive so crazy."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 180, "phrase": "And people can make a choice. Okay, they want to drive aggressively. In that case it will be higher insurance. They want to be more careful in their driving, it’ll be pay less. It’s just also actually very helpful for us to have a feedback loop to see what is driving insurance expense. A lot of it is just, you have like a little fender bender, and the next fender bender, because of the way that the body or collision repair is being done, costs $15,000 or something crazy. We can actually adjust the design of the car, and adjust how the repair is done, to actually have the fundamental cost of solving that problem be less."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 182, "phrase": "So this has helped us unearthed a bunch of silly things we were doing, basically. Without realizing it. This is a problem in general with insurance. It’s like, if insurance is like, all you can eat, then the feedback loop for improvement is weak."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 184, "phrase": "So this gives us a great feedback loop for improvement. It gives us basically a fundamentally better insurance product."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 186, "phrase": "I’d also like to say, in the spirit of recruiting, if there’s one thing I’d like to come out of this call, it’s that a lot of great people want to join Tesla. That’s the number one thing I’d like out of this call. And on the insurance front, I want to be clear, we’re building a great, major insurance company. If you’re interested in revolutionary insurance, please join Tesla. I would love to have some high energy actuaries, especially. I have great respect for the actuarial profession. You guys are great at math. Please join Tesla. Especially if you want to change things, and you’re annoyed by how slow the industry is. This is the place to be. We want revolutionary actuaries."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 188, "phrase": "Okay, thank you very much [crosstalk 00:43:49]."}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 190, "phrase": "Sorry, there was a second part of this question. Will Tesla insurance be required to participate in the Tesla ride hailing network?"}, {"author": "Zach Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 192, "phrase": "And so, I think I’ve answered this before in prior calls, but by the time the ride hailing network is available, we will, Tesla insurance will be provided for folks who are in this network. It’s a different type of insurance because of the use of the car. It’s not decided whether third party insurance versus Tesla insurance will be required. There might be some things we need to think through there, but Tesla Insurance at least will be working, working for the ride hailing network."}, {"author": "Speaker 4", "serial_number": 194, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And in the interest of time, let’s go to the Q&A of analysts online."}, {"author": "Speaker 6", "serial_number": 196, "phrase": "Thank you. Our first question will come from Dan [Levy 00:44:34] from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Dan Levy", "serial_number": 198, "phrase": "High. Good afternoon, thank you. I’ll ask a question on the quarter, and a question more broadly on strategy. Just on the quarter, if you could give us an update on gross margin with China [inaudible 00:44:53] gross margin in the second quarter, and give us an idea of how far off Model Y gross margin was versus Fremont Model 3, and just more broadly on strategy. It seems like your approach-"}, {"author": "Speaker 7", "serial_number": 200, "phrase": "… and then just more broadly on strategy. It seems like your approach to insourcing is varying by region. You’re insourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you’re relying a lot more on the supply chain in Shanghai. What do you expect your approach to be on insourcing when you eventually opened up Berlin? And what’s your Texas factory is going to be? Thank you."}, {"author": "Speaker 8", "serial_number": 202, "phrase": "Yeah. Just to start with the gross margin questions. We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken. The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp. So we think there’s continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there. Model Y. As we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production. And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see a pretty substantial improvement in the Model Y margin. And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structure will converge. They’re not quite there, Model Y still slightly more expensive than Model 3. And it’s not yet at full production. And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can back into the math there on the relative gross margins."}, {"author": "Speaker 9", "serial_number": 204, "phrase": "Yeah and the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory. It’s continuing to do more and more internally. The thing that’s really helping is there were previously a ton of parts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world. And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle. The proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at five to 10% a month. It was 40% at the beginning of this year getting or something like that. It will be 80%, by the end of this year, maybe more."}, {"author": "Speaker 10", "serial_number": 206, "phrase": "Varied. Also a lot of very strong, very component and very eager suppliers around the factory in Shanghai."}, {"author": "Speaker 9", "serial_number": 208, "phrase": "Yeah. I’ve seen the suppliers in China have been extremely competitive, possibly the most competitive in the world."}, {"author": "Speaker 10", "serial_number": 210, "phrase": "And so far we’re in negotiations for Berlin and we’ll go where there is a lot of business. Also a lot of suppliers in Germany or the rest of Europe, they are eager to support the factory [inaudible 00:47:30] . Yeah."}, {"author": "Speaker 9", "serial_number": 212, "phrase": "Yeah. Well obviously Germany has a great automotive industry and supply chain. So actually a ton of our suppliers are in Germany within a few hundred kilometers of the factory."}, {"author": "Speaker 11", "serial_number": 214, "phrase": "Thank you very much. Let’s go to the next question please."}, {"author": "Speaker 12", "serial_number": 216, "phrase": "My next question will come from Tony [Sakanagi 00:47:52] with Bernstein. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Tony Sakanagi", "serial_number": 218, "phrase": "Yes. Thank you. You mentioned in the slide deck a couple of times That you were pleased with gross margin with PTI March in progress, and you expect it to achieve industry leading operating margins over time. Maybe you could shed a little light on that. Industry leading for luxury vendors is eight to 10% PTI for Porsche who’s smaller it’s 17, for mass market vendors it’s five to eight. What do we think about and how much ultimately do you believe that EV credits will contribute to that margin? Because I know your margin has been 5% over the last 12 months, but it’s actually less than 1% excluding EV credits. So it’s a four point contribution right now. How do we think about ultimately what industry leading margins are? And how much of that you think is coming from EV credits, regulatory credits? And I have a follow up please."}, {"author": "Speaker 8", "serial_number": 220, "phrase": "Sure. I’ve mentioned this before in terms of regulatory credits. We manage the business, said differently we don’t manage the business with the assumption that regulatory credits will contribute in a significant way to the future I do expect regulatory credit and revenue to double in 2020 relative to 2019. And it’ll continue for some period of time, but eventually the stream of regulatory credits will reduce."}, {"author": "Speaker 9", "serial_number": 222, "phrase": "Yes. It’s worth noting that buyers of our car in the US receive zero federal tax credit. Whereas many of our competitors, they get a $7,500 tax credit. And yet not sales have continued to do well."}, {"author": "Speaker 8", "serial_number": 224, "phrase": "Yep. And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce, manufacture, and distribute our cars. That cost of, even for mature products like the S and the X continues to come down as we do work on that. Model 3, which is our second most mature product that continues to come down. You then layer on top of that, as Elan was discussing earlier, the potential for software based revenue, particularly full self driving. There’s the revenue recognition portion of that that we have today. And that will expand as we release more features. And then you can layer on top of that in the future, our revenue from a ride hailing network."}, {"author": "Speaker 8", "serial_number": 226, "phrase": "Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue. There’s still incredible opportunity there that we we’re working on. Particularly on how customers interact with the company from sales, and service and what their flow is, and how we get cars to them. So we continue to see efficiencies there. So in the medium term here, what our modeling shows is in the low teams operating margin level. And I think there continues the opportunity to drive that up. I hear your point on the 5% and the 1%. We’re on a bit of a journey here and we’re continuing to be partners."}, {"author": "Tony Sakanagi", "serial_number": 228, "phrase": "Thank you. And if I could just follow up Elan, you’ve talked a lot about the mission of the company and really trying to drive EV adoption globally. So how do you think about that trade off between driving towards industry leading profitability yet trying to make your cars more affordable and broader? It feels like historically you’ve always picked the path of, “I’d rather drive more growth and more adoption because ultimately that’s the mission of the company.” And we even saw it a little bit this quarter with price reductions. You could have probably kept price where it is sold some units and had better profits, but that’s been an ongoing choice that Tesla as a company has made. So how do you personally think about that trade off, even if you were to get to industry leading margins, wouldn’t you be inclined to give more of that back to drive a greater adoption more quickly?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 230, "phrase": "Well, I think we actually achieve both when you factor in autonomy. I think we can go way beyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentially almost everyone when factoring in autonomy. But that was really a mega game-changer, [inaudible 00:52:42] changer."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 232, "phrase": "Yeah. It is important for people to distinguish between two things. There’s value for money that a product has, and then there’s affordability. And even if you rail value for money and have value for money, infinite. If people do not have enough money in the bank account to buy the car, they simply cannot. So then you just have this awesome thing and nobody can buy. so it is important to make the car affordable. We will not succeed in our mission if we do not make cars affordable."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 234, "phrase": "The thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are not affordable enough. We need me to fix that. So we’re all making progress in that regard, just steadily making progress. So we need to not go bankrupt, obviously that’s important because that will fail in our mission. But we’re not trying to be super profitable either. Obviously profitability is like one or 2%. It’s not crazy. Last quarter was only 0.1%. So we want to be profitable. I think just, we want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible. That’s what we’re trying to achieve."}, {"author": "Speaker 11", "serial_number": 236, "phrase": "Thank you. Let’s go to the next question please."}, {"author": "Speaker 12", "serial_number": 238, "phrase": "Our next question will come from Emmanuel [Rossmore 00:54:28] with Deutsche Bank. Please. Go ahead."}, {"author": "Emmanuel Rossmore", "serial_number": 240, "phrase": "Hi, good afternoon. Could you please characterize the current near term demand environment for your vehicles? These obviously unusual times, I think back in Q1 you had indicated direct [inaudible 00:54:43] backlog I guess at the beginning of this past quarter. I haven’t seen any specific comments about new orders as a backlog and then release today. So can you give us some color?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 242, "phrase": "Demand is not our problem. Definitely not. We do have some production supply chain challenges we’re trying to solve right now. For example, the Model Y rear body casting, obviously, because it’s new technology, it’s been tricky to maintain rate and keep growing the rate for Model Y casting. Which it’s a two piece casting and there’s about half a dozen other parts that are added on that will transition to a one piece casting. If I can predict super excited about this. We’re going to have the world’s biggest casting press is getting assembled right now actually in Fremont for the Model Y rear body casting. It’s enormous and it looks awesome. So the things that are troubling us right now are not demand that they are just a bunch of fire fighting on supply chain and production issues."}, {"author": "Emmanuel Rossmore", "serial_number": 244, "phrase": "Okay two part [crosstalk 00:56:03]."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 246, "phrase": "Sorry. Yeah, don’t worry about demand. That’s not the issue."}, {"author": "Emmanuel Rossmore", "serial_number": 248, "phrase": "Okay. So when you’re saying achieving 500,000 deliveries has become more difficult was it’s really just a function of the recent shutdown and some of these supply dynamics?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 250, "phrase": "Yeah. It’s not [inaudible 00:56:21] demand it’s really just a production issue. It’s pretty hard when you’ve got a global supply chain and it’s whatever the most effective part of that global supply chain is, that sets your rate. So the number of rabbits we’ve had to pull out of hat for supply chain is insane. Team’s done an amazing job. So I think it also some of our server costs were related to having to use a lot of airplanes to get parts around because of parts shortages. So hopefully get use for your airplanes, that will improve our costs. But it’s a dramatic feed supply right now. That’s where we are now."}, {"author": "Speaker 11", "serial_number": 252, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And the last question, please"}, {"author": "Speaker 12", "serial_number": 254, "phrase": "Our last question today, we’ll [Phillipe Hoofweiss 00:57:21] with Jefferies. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Phillipe", "serial_number": 256, "phrase": "Good afternoon. And thank you. You mentioned a few times to us the constraint to growth fees is vary capacity still. And I was hoping you could clarify the scope of the Berlin plants we’re building right now. Will there be the battery capacity consistence with the amount of assembly volume you expect to come out of Berlin? And if not, will you be able to source your battery requirements out of Europe? Or would you have to import batteries from outside of Europe to ensure production and building?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 258, "phrase": "Okay, well, we can’t say too much about this, except that there will be local cell production. And that will serve the needs of the Berlin factory. [inaudible 00:13:19]."}, {"author": "Speaker 13", "serial_number": 260, "phrase": "No, that’s straightforward enough. I think just adding to what you said earlier about talent and people."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 262, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Speaker 13", "serial_number": 264, "phrase": "The same goes in all areas of cell."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 266, "phrase": "Yes."}, {"author": "Speaker 13", "serial_number": 268, "phrase": "Supply chain, manufacturing, materials, design. We are solving this problem. And we’re treating it like any other problems that we have solved. We will solve this problem and want talented people to join us as we solve these problems."}, {"author": "Speaker 9", "serial_number": 270, "phrase": "Yes. To my biggest concern for getting talented people is just probably Berlin because labor mobility in Europe is not as low. I would recommend changing this. If somebody wants to leave and join another company, sometimes they have to spend six months on garden leave it’s called hang out in the garden basically. And this is not a good use of people’s time. If they want us to hang out in the garden, that’s fine, but they shouldn’t have to."}, {"author": "Speaker 11", "serial_number": 272, "phrase": "Thank you."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 274, "phrase": "Those who know Europe will know what I’m talking about."}, {"author": "Speaker 11", "serial_number": 276, "phrase": "Okay. Phillip did we have a follow up question?"}, {"author": "Phillipe", "serial_number": 278, "phrase": "No, that’s fine. Thank you very much."}, {"author": "Speaker 11", "serial_number": 280, "phrase": "Okay. Thank you very much for everyone for joining this call and thank you for all your good questions. And we’ll speak to you again in about three months."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 282, "phrase": "Yeah. Have you seen her with [inaudible 00:14:46]."}, {"author": "Speaker 9", "serial_number": 284, "phrase": "Thanks."}]}

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press *1 on your telephone. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. If you require any further assistance, please press *0. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director for Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 2, "phrase": "Thank you, Sharon, and good afternoon everyone, and welcome to the Tesla’s first quarter 2020 Q&A webcast. I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn, and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 1:00 PM Pacific time in the update that we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we’ll discuss our business outlook and make forward looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings for the SEC. During the question and answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Please press *1 now if you would like to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 4, "phrase": "Thank you. So Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks. This is the first time we have achieved positive gap net income in a seasonally weak first quarter. Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, while wrapping two major products. What we’ve learned from this is that… We’ve actually learned a lot here. After the Model 3 ramp from three years ago, our new products get ramped faster and become profitable sooner. In Q1, we produced more model wise in the first quarter than Model 3 in Fremont in the first two quarters. Thus far, and Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1. More surprisingly, in other words, we’re ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already. Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven’t achieved with any product in the past."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 6, "phrase": "Regarding autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to early access users in March and to all US customers with full stop driving package just last week. Our cars will now automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to proceed. I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel that it is probably a safety improvement."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 8, "phrase": "We are collecting data from over a million intersections every month at this point. This number will grow exponentially as more people get the updates and as more people start driving again. Soon we will be collecting data from over a billion intersections per month. All of those confirmations are training annual net. Essentially, the driver when driving and taking action is effectively labeling reality as they drive and making the neural net better and better. I think this is an advantage that no one else has and we’re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined. I think this is difficult to fully appreciate. It’s the reason, I have to say, it’s very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because everyone is training Google all the time with their searches. So when you’re searching something and you click on a link, you’re training Google every time you do that. It’s just very difficult for any new search engine to compete on that basis."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 10, "phrase": "So all those confirmations are creating a neural net and soon cars will be able to drive through an intersection without a confirmation as well as to make turns, and I feel extremely confident that it will be possible to do a drive from your home to your office most of the time with no interventions by the end of the year. We can almost do this already with the leading edge alpha builds that are driving the car."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 12, "phrase": "So let’s see, on another technology front, or fronts, we increased the range of Model S and X yet again, this time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X. It should be said that actually the real Model X range is 400 miles. But when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately the EPA left the car door open and the keys in the car, and they did this overnight. And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost 2% of its range, and as a result had a 391 on the test. As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we’ll redo the test and we’re actually in the confident that we will achieve a 400 mile or greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months, the true range of the Model S for the past two months has been 400 miles. And of course we’re not stopping there. We’ll always continue pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and all the little details that makes a Tesla special. For model Y, we introduced the revolutionary two piece rear underwater casting, that we’re going to making a single piece casting a later this year. Meaning essentially, the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, which no casting of the size of complexity has ever been done before. In fact, there isn’t even anything that is on par with the two piece casting for the Model Y. So we’re really pushing the envelope on the vehicle’s structural engineering and manufacturing. I’m very excited about this approach, as it allows us to reduce the weight, the cost and improve NVH. It’s better in every way, essentially."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 14, "phrase": "For the model I also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range. So the Model Y has remarkable range on par with, in fact, probably slightly better than, I guess, the Model 3, despite being a bigger car that weighs more, and the heat pump is a key contributor to that. It is especially excellent at low temperature driving. And the feedback we’re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive. We’re confident that this product will be our best selling product ever."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 16, "phrase": "So in conclusion, and just looking at looking forward, I guess this is a forward looking statement. We are absolutely continuing our model wide capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai, and here in Fremont when they will let us continue. Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, but you can count on our products will be even more competitive over time. While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite. We are absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company. And we’re really looking forward to being, in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and Europe at a capacity of well over a million units a year. So there’s a [inaudible 00:08:59] to look forward to, and we can’t wait to tell you what’s going to happen. Thank you."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 18, "phrase": "Thank you. And now to Zach’s opening remarks."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 20, "phrase": "Yeah, thanks Martin and thanks Elon. I’m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter. A few things to highlight and add to what Ellen just mentioned, we successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly ahead of schedule. And this is our second large scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017, and it’s evidence to the progress we’ve made on cost control and ramp efficiency. It’s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of production. Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalence of Model 3s built in Fremont. This is despite not yet running at full capacity while also managing through the production shutdown in early February. We also announced a long range and performance variant of Model 3 per our roadmap, which will positively impact ASPs in China."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 22, "phrase": "On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the exploration of government incentives at the end of Q4. In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest ever backlog, yet again. Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first ever Q1 profit. Automotive growth margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits remain strong for all products despite charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime. We continue to make progress on OPEX efficiency as well as our service and other margins. Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1, limiting deployments. We also experienced expected launch inefficiencies associated with our third version of the solar roof which impacted overall profitability. As I’ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which are credits we sell to other car makers, to generally increase with time. This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4. And note that most of the credit revenue it did not contribute to cashing Q1 and it’s reflected in the accounts receivable on the balance sheet."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 24, "phrase": "Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations. Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash flows. As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our longterm plans and technology roadmap. We are taking the near term actions that are required to continue those investments. Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we’re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai. In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and profitability to the company. In Fremont, we’re working towards restarting production as soon as that’s possible."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 26, "phrase": "We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter. Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cashflows in Q1 but it’s helpful in Q2. Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles. While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online orders despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering. However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown and Fremont will have an impact on our near term financial performance and we will need to work through how quickly we’ll be able to ramp production to prior levels. More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately. Working capital management, in particular raw material inventory, is the single most important lever in managing our cash flows during this time."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 28, "phrase": "The Tesla team has done a great job here. We’ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce noncritical expenses and optional investments while continuing to drive efficiencies throughout the business. Overall, we’ve modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remained comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed fully with our most important longterm investments. It’s important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company and this is aided by the substantial work we’ve done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity, and we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required. So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 30, "phrase": "Thank you very much. So we’ll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by safe technologies. The first question from an institutional investor is, “Most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite most vehicles having old unnecessary hardware, what levers could you pull to accelerate the adoption and deepen your data advantage? For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?”"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 32, "phrase": "I think we will offer full stop driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year. I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option, as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the future and we are confident that is an investment that will pay off to the consumer, to the benefit of the consumer, and in my opinion, buying the FSD option is something people will not regret doing."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 34, "phrase": "I agree. And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is-"}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 36, "phrase": "… of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease will be the least expensive way on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value with time."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 38, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 40, "phrase": "We do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront, and so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription at the time."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 42, "phrase": "Yeah, absolutely. I should mention at a high level our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness. That is our goal. We think that’s the kind of thing that all companies should try to do. It’s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty, the guest loyalty. Our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we’re confident that if we were to behave like that then customers, in turn, will behave the same way to us."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 44, "phrase": "Thank you. The second question for Institutional Investor is, China recently announced changes to its NEV Subsidy Program that disqualifies Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies. To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer so they can qualify for the subsidy?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 46, "phrase": "Yeah. We are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China, and we’re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3 basically tomorrow China time, so the day after tomorrow California time, but tomorrow China time. That will be a price below the subsidy limit. We feel confident that that will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 48, "phrase": "Yeah, and on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai and Taiwan is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there’s still significant opportunity left to take cost out. So a fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest of the year, were not fully localized on the supply chain yet, and so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it’s not complete and there’s additional opportunities there. We’ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin cost down and expand margin even with this reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 50, "phrase": "Thank you. The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crises. In which way has Tesla improved or is expected to improve coming out of Covid 19?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 52, "phrase": "Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company. One always has to do that in a crisis. Just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do, and we came to conclusion that the right move is actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in the future and new technologies, even though it is risky. We’ve talked to some of our key investors and they support that approach as well. I think that there’s clearly an uncertain future ahead. It’s a bit of a bumpy road, but I think the longterm prospects are extremely good. Anything you guys want to add?"}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 54, "phrase": "Yeah, I agree with that, Elon. The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think is great. The other one that I would add is it’s always been our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make that as digital as possible."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 56, "phrase": "Yeah. Touchless delivery."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 58, "phrase": "Touchless delivery, mobile service, touchless sales, has been something that we’ve been very focused on and made a lot of progress on."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 60, "phrase": "Yeah. The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone. You can order a car and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paperwork and everything done. That’s it. Effortless."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 62, "phrase": "And many customers do that."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 64, "phrase": "And they’re doing it, yes. In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this is something you can do, because normally buying a car is quite a pain. For most people, they would rather go to the dentist than buy a new car. Actually my dentist is great, but it’s really like quite an arduous thing. When the typical retail experience with buying a new car is more painful to people than having a root canal, then you have to say, whoa. For Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something from the Apple app store or ordering something on Amazon, except it’s a car. Yeah. In five minutes. If you really went fast, I think you could order a car probably in 90 seconds."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 66, "phrase": "Thank you. The next question from Institutional Investor is, can you give us a brief preview of the Battery Day by generally highlighting steps Tesla is taking to improve cell energy density and timeline for introduction?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 68, "phrase": "Yeah, actually. We don’t want to preempt Battery Day. We want to leave the exciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of exciting news to tell, and I think it would be one of the most exciting days in Tesla’s history. We’re just trying to figure out the right timing for that. We think probably the right timing will be probably the third week of May. I’m not giving a firm date, but we think that probably that’s the right timing, and depending upon what we’re allowed to do, it’ll either be in California or Texas."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 70, "phrase": "Okay. And the last question from Institutional Investors, could you please update on progress toward development and commercialization of Full Self-Driving? How much revenue have you recognized so far?"}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 72, "phrase": "Just a couple of things on the financials for Full Self-Driving. Currently in North America it’s sold for $7,000 as an option. We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of it goes into deferred revenue. That’s associated with features that will be released with time. Our deferred revenue balance is continuing to grow. It’s a little bit over $600 million, and so as we release features with time, at the end of every quarter we take a look at what features have been released, associated value, and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our financials for that quarter. Then cars going forward, once a feature is released, we can recognize that revenue. We reduce the amount of deferral and we can recognize that revenue within period. This is what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 74, "phrase": "Absolutely. There’s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential, with the fleet out there that could upgrade to turn on autopilot, basic autopilot or Full Self-Driving, and that’s something we will enable just as a support in-app purchase, or as we talked about earlier, towards the end of the year as a subscription. That’s just a lot of untapped potential there. That’s not in the deferred revenue line obviously, but is certainly a great deal of deferred potential that we think is a large portion which is likely to reach fruition."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 76, "phrase": "Thank you. Now let’s go to questions from retail investors. Question number one, Elon has mentioned a 50% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past. Is this still in line with Tesla’s ambitions for the next 5 to 10 years? This would 4 million vehicles in 2025 and more than 20 million vehicles in 2030. Is 40% a more realistic target?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 78, "phrase": "Well, it’s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be. I think very few people would have predicted the unexpected sort of roundhouse that Covid came up with that sort of came out of nowhere. I think in the absence of some massive force majeure event, like quite massive, I think probably 50% is the likely number. It’s possible that it’s 40%. I would be very shocked if it’s less than 40%, even with a force majeure, short of World War Three."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 80, "phrase": "Okay. The next question from retail investors, when will you announce the next Giga? How many Gigas do you have planned for the next five years?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 82, "phrase": "I think we’ll announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month. We may not as soon as next month. That’s not a prediction. It’s just saying that could happen. It will certainly be within three months, and possibly one month. That would be in the US. As for how many will be in five years, I don’t know right now what that number would be. I guess several more than there are today, but I’m not sure what exactly it would be in five years, but some number more than today."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 84, "phrase": "I’ll also add that our Gigas have gotten bigger."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 86, "phrase": "Yes. And arguably could be start being called Tera."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 88, "phrase": "Yeah. With multiple products, as well. The absolute number of Giga factories we may ultimately build might be less, but each one is larger, and that’s under our belief that it shows significant efficiencies by having as much as possible and similar product lines under the same roof and as much vertical integration as possible all in one facility."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 90, "phrase": "Thank you. The next question is can you give us an update on solar roof ramp? How many are you currently able to install per week? What is your installation’s per weeks targets for the end of 2021?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 92, "phrase": "We were actually gaining interest momentum with the solar roof before Covid, and Covid essentially shut us down, both from the ability to install and the ability to get permits. The permit offices were closed, and we were shelter-in-place, live-in-place. We obviously cannot install if you can’t get permits and you can’t physically do it, it’s physically impossible. But I think the longterm trend for solar roof is extremely good, and I’m confident that let’s say within the next, I don’t know, year or maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of a thousand a week."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 94, "phrase": "That’s not in the middle of winter or something. Allowing for seasonality, it’s hard to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice, but in spring I think it’s installing, which is the hard part. We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit a thousand a week gross build rate for the solar glass roof already, so that’s not a problem. It’s building up the install teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry installers, and internally we want to have at least a thousand solar roof install teams, taking a week or perhaps a little less than a week to do an install, which gets you a thousand a week roof installations. We see demand is good, production is good, so it’s really all about the install. Then, like I said, also building up the training, the very diverse group of companies in the roofing industry, to also install solar roof, that I think will allow us to scale far beyond a thousand a week."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 96, "phrase": "We’re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America, so we do expect this to be a product that is international, and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from China on the solar roof. We’re confident that this will be a very significant product for the company over time."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 98, "phrase": "Thank you. The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla’s plan to enter the residential and/or commercial HVAC market? Can you provide some basics of how your system will work, whether you consider the heat-pump water heater market as well?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 100, "phrase": "Well as I said on Twitter, I’m personally extremely excited to build a kick ass HVAC system that also has a sort of hospital grade particle filtration, basically HEPA filtration, that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi, and also neutralizes-"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 102, "phrase": "… and it also neutralizes acidic alkaline gases; that is quiet and efficient. And these are all things we’ve achieved in that car. By the way, in fact, I don’t know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S and X are the only cars in the world that have a hospital operating room-grade HEPA filters built in. They’re very big, but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 104, "phrase": "And 3 and Y have like MERV 16 or 15 capable filtration also, which is-"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 106, "phrase": "Yeah. It’s not like Model 3 and Y… They’re no slouches. Model 3 and Y, they’re way better than any other car to the best of my knowledge. They’re not quite as good as hospital operating room, but they’re extremely good. Way better than any other normal car. And we’re continuing to improve the filters on 3 and Y. I believe these actually have a big effect on health, even in normal, just day-to-day living. It’s reducing particle count and it has an effect on allergies and all sorts of things. Air quality is incredibly important, even in a non-COVID situation, extremely important."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 108, "phrase": "So taking all those things that we’ve learned and applying them to how a commercial HVAC would be just very exciting. And then if you’re condensing water, like one of our goals is to have it be a water source. If you have water, you possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 110, "phrase": "Yeah, use it as a heat source if you need it instead of the outdoors when the outdoors is really cold."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 112, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 114, "phrase": "Or the other way around. So lots of options."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 116, "phrase": "And it could be a hell of a product. So we just have to… At Tesla we have a real tendency to bite off more than we can chew on the car front. So we’ve got to make sure… We have a lot of irons in the fire here for new products like the Cybertrucks, Semi, new Roadster, and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world, and this brilliant Model Y, and Autopilot, and the solar roof and-"}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 118, "phrase": "New technologies."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 120, "phrase": "Yeah, exactly. Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack. We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage. More than we can supply, at least for 2020. [inaudible 00:02:35]."}, {"author": "Male moderator", "serial_number": 122, "phrase": "Thank you. And the last question from the retail is, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like the Hornsdale Power Reserve and Moss Landing instead of selling them battery storage? Does it make sense for Tesla to buy peaker plants and convert them?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 124, "phrase": "Well, we haven’t really thought about that yet. So it’s not out of the question, but our brain is full. Excuse me, sir, our brain is full. I saw the question. Our overarching goal is to help accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. And the three elements of that are sustainable power generation, then you’ve got to store the power, stationary storage, and then you’ve got to have electric transportation."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 126, "phrase": "But we don’t have like specific market share goals or anything like that. It’s just to the degree that we can accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, we think that’s a fundamental good for the world and we want to do that as fast as possible. But it’s not, like I said, market share growth as a goal in and of itself. It’s just the faster this happens, the better off the world is."}, {"author": "Male moderator", "serial_number": 128, "phrase": "Thank you very much. And I think now we can can move to analyst questions."}, {"author": "Female announcer", "serial_number": 130, "phrase": "Thank you. Our first question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Adam Jonas", "serial_number": 132, "phrase": "Thanks everybody. I hope everyone’s safe and healthy. I got one question; one follow-up. And I’ll point out, I’ve had a root canal before. And I would agree Elon, it was less painful than buying a car."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 134, "phrase": "Exactly. I mean, it really is… Yeah, exactly."}, {"author": "Adam Jonas", "serial_number": 136, "phrase": "Yeah. It’s a big problem, actually. It’s a big problem."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 138, "phrase": "It’s crazy. Yes."}, {"author": "Adam Jonas", "serial_number": 140, "phrase": "A different conversation."}, {"author": "Adam Jonas", "serial_number": 142, "phrase": "Zach, first for you, any real-time update on company liquidity at the end of April? Some companies have, given the circumstances, gone out of their way to give a little color on that. Just wanted to give you a shot at that. And I got a follow-up."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 144, "phrase": "Yeah, it’s a fair question. I don’t have any additional color to provide. 8.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q1. We’re managing it very closely. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have an increase in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver at the end of Q1. So we’re making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for liquidity."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 146, "phrase": "And as we’ve been looking at liquidity, we’ve been looking at this over the next 18 months and there’s ups and downs to the liquidity. Currently now, as we’re not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we’re paying off. But then in a couple of months we’ll quickly be through that and then we’ll have a gap in payables, since we don’t have any parts coming in. So it does go up and down a little bit. But in looking at the long term horizon, which is how we’re managing it right now, we feel pretty comfortable with the liquidity position of the company."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 148, "phrase": "Yeah, yeah. I should say, we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area and that should be identified as a serious risk. We only have two car factories right now. One in Shanghai and one in the Bay Area. And the Bay Area produces the vast majority of our cars. All of S and X and most of the 3 and all of the Y. So the extension of the shelter-in-place, or, frankly, I would call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights, but that’s my opinion. And erasing people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came to America or built this country. What the fuck? Excuse me. People… The outrage, it’s just an outrage."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 150, "phrase": "But it will cause great harm, not just to Tesla, but to many companies. And while Tesla will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not. Everything people have worked for their whole life is being destroyed in real time. And we’re going to have many suppliers and are having many suppliers that are having super hard times, especially the small ones. And it’s just causing a lot of strife to a lot of people. Yeah."}, {"author": "Adam Jonas", "serial_number": 152, "phrase": "Well, Elon, on that point, you mentioned people that gave their lives to build the country. My thought’s for you on this. There’ve been a lot of comparisons drawn to the state of the US economy to the early 1930s when Roosevelt began a series of new deals and infrastructure projects, or post-World War II when Eisenhower launched the US Highway Act. And when JFK launched the Apollo Program, which you could say was influenced by the Cold War, clearly, and you’ve benefited from, and our space program benefited from."}, {"author": "Adam Jonas", "serial_number": 154, "phrase": "What would be your message to US lawmakers on this call as we, in addition to your opinions on shelter-in-place, but thinking of longer term, your message to US lawmakers coming out of the crisis? Specifically around EV infrastructure and a chance to kind of work with taxpayers to support sustainable transport, renewable energy. I’m wondering if you see this as a chance to make the crisis and all the loss and lives lost, not be in vain. Thanks."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 156, "phrase": "I think it’s high time we invested in infrastructure in this country. We have a lot of crumbling highways and bridges. And frankly, when I visit China I see their infrastructure as being much better than ours; it’s great. Europe has better infrastructure. It’s really quite sad that the US infrastructure, especially sort of roads and highways, is where it is today. And our airports in a lot of cases are an embarrassment. And it’s not just a question of money, it’s a question of will. And as soon as we spend a lot of money on these things, but what do we gain for it?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 158, "phrase": "And yeah, we really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future and not the transportation for the past. If this was 1920, do you want to be investing in steam engines or internal combustion engines? Obviously not steam engines. So this is a time to think about the future and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people’s rights? As what is happening right now? I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry. It’s just like, if somebody wants to stay in their house, that’s great. They should be allowed to stay in their house and they should not be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom."}, {"author": "Male moderator", "serial_number": 160, "phrase": "Okay. Let’s go to the next question, please."}, {"author": "Female announcer", "serial_number": 162, "phrase": "Thank you. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Emmanuel Rosner", "serial_number": 164, "phrase": "Hi. Good evening. Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is already positive at such low volume. How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model 3? What other factors should we think about and what does that mean for the ampler, for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 166, "phrase": "Zach?"}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 168, "phrase": "Sure. A couple of thoughts there for Y. The first is it does carry a higher ASP, so on the revenue side it carries a higher ASP than Model 3. And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars. So we started with deliveries of performance, initially, and so that helps create some of the margin. And that will come down with time as more variants are released and we have more of a steady state mix. But it’s similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model 3 when we launched that product in Fremont two years ago."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 170, "phrase": "On the cost side, and I think you hit on a couple of the buckets. The commonality is huge. It’s very important. And in addition to that, the manufacturing processes are very similar to Model 3 as well. And so we have experienced with that, both with Model 3 in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai. And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well. So the ecosystem to support and launch the product is there. There remain a lot of opportunities to continue to take cost out of the car. The number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to where we’ll go."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 172, "phrase": "Yeah, it’s good. It will take cost out of the car and make the product better."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 174, "phrase": "Exactly."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 176, "phrase": "So, it’s not make the part worse. Any fool can take cost out of a car, make it worse. We want to take cost out of the car, figure out how to make it lighter and simpler. And so, it’s we want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering cost. But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect the marginal cost of that car to be comparable to the Model 3 once we have reached say [pap 00:42:42] to 10 or 20,000 units or something like that. And have gone-"}, {"author": "Female announcer", "serial_number": 178, "phrase": "Speakers, you’re back online."}, {"author": "Male moderator", "serial_number": 180, "phrase": "Hi, sorry we got disconnected for some reason. What was the question again?"}, {"author": "Male moderator", "serial_number": 182, "phrase": "Okay. Now let’s go to the next question please."}, {"author": "Female announcer", "serial_number": 184, "phrase": "The next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Benjamin Kallo", "serial_number": 186, "phrase": "Hey, thank you very much. Just wondering about the cell strategy. In Reno, you have obviously integrated there, but you’re buying cells, I think, in Shanghai. And then what we think in Germany. And so how are you looking at that going forward?"}, {"author": "Benjamin Kallo", "serial_number": 188, "phrase": "And then if you could just talk about Mr. Mizuno and that board addition and kind of the process with adding into the board. Thank you."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 190, "phrase": "Sure. From a sales perspective, with all the partners we’ve had historically and in the future, we’re just looking for competitive technology and competitive pricing. I think we’ll talk a little bit more about this on battery investor day, how we’re approaching all of it. But yeah, I mean, we don’t have one model we’re restricting ourselves to pursue, we’re just trying to find what’s best for the products and in the long run. And then the other question about the board, I wasn’t able to hear it."}, {"author": "Male moderator", "serial_number": 192, "phrase": "Sorry, we couldn’t hear the second part of the question."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino", "serial_number": 194, "phrase": "Yeah. I was asking about Mr. Mizuno entering the board and kind of the process behind that and what he brings to the board."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 196, "phrase": "Oh, I think… Well, we all need a Hiro. But obviously he brings a tremendous amount of experience investing at the highest levels in the world and has done incredible work at the Japan pension fund, which is the largest funder of any kind in the world. And-"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 198, "phrase": "Of any kind in the world. And generally the conversations over the years, he’s just shown an incredible insight into how the securities or the global security markets work and what he thinks is where the areas for reform. He just looks like to have a strong philosophical underpinning about how to make the future better. And shares that view regarding the environment, and just a very sensible, smart person who brings a lot to the board and I think is generally recognized as such by many people."}, {"author": "Benjamin Kallo", "serial_number": 200, "phrase": "I guess looking into the Panasonic relationship, maybe just how is that relationship going here? And is there any readthrough on bringing him onto the board? Thank you."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 202, "phrase": "No, I think this is [inaudible 00:46:07] with the Panasonic relationship. I mean I have a great relationship with Panasonic CEO. We meet regularly one-on-one and talk all the time and so that relationship is strong. He would bring more of a broader and a global strategic view to the board."}, {"author": "Moderator", "serial_number": 204, "phrase": "Thank you. Let’s go to the next question please."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 206, "phrase": "Our next question will come from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Gene Munster", "serial_number": 208, "phrase": "Congratulations on the progress, you talked about full autonomy by the end of the year. I would love for you to walk through the roll out strategy of the Tesla network app and how that’s going to look prior to the robo taxi stage. Are you going to gradually take over human routes with autonomous capable routes over time or how do you see that playing out?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 210, "phrase": "Well, it’s pretty much going to play out as it has played out, which is will release more and more functionality. Before we release any functionality, it goes through extensive testing and of course we ramp up a simulations team that has a very good simulation of the real world. So we run any code changes through a battery of tests in simulation. Then we have a global QA team, which I’m on actually. I’m on the global QA team, and we test the releases in the real world, real world play out, the differences between the real world and the simulation which are very many because the world is very complex. And then we release it to a small group of private beta testers within the company, then to a larger beta audience including people outside the company, then to early access Tesla owners and then finally a broader release."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 212, "phrase": "And so there are many stages that these things go through. So by the time something is going to wide release into the US, it has gone through all of those stages, and the software that’s at the very early stage is much more vast than what people are seeing. So there’s just got to go through a very rigorous safety process. So essentially we need to figure out is if they’re very good at complex intersections, they’re very good at complex turns in intersections, and things like busy malls in a parking lot, or office park or special events and sporting events, that kind of thing, when those eventually come back. But yeah, those are extra hard cases but it’s all tracking very well. I feel like the auto pilot engineering team is, we just have an extremely talented group and I’m deeply involved with the team. So we talk every week and meet every week when we can, [inaudible 00:49:44] physical meetings difficult."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 214, "phrase": "So I have quite a deep understanding of where we are, where we’re headed, and I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum and we’ll have the functionality [inaudible 00:50:00], full self driving, by the end of the year. Then after that functionality is released, there’s still another step which is to improve the reliability of it. Once it’s released to kind of full self driving with humans supervision, supervised by the driver. And then we keep improving the reliability to the point where it no longer needs to be supervised by the driver and we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this was the case, and then presumably the regulators, depending on which jurisdiction it is, would give approval for fully autonomous cars that can drive with no human on board."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 216, "phrase": "Obviously the regulatory approval process, that’s difficult for us to predict with accuracy because it’s out of our hands, but for the rest of it, I feel very good about where we are. [crosstalk 00:51:03]."}, {"author": "Gene Munster", "serial_number": 218, "phrase": "So to summarize, we’re going to get owner’s full autonomy, some level of that by the end of the year. And then a human in the loop, Tesla Network app sometime, is it first half of next year? Would that be the hope?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 220, "phrase": "Do you mean like when can the car drive with no person?"}, {"author": "Gene Munster", "serial_number": 222, "phrase": "No, with a person. Initially a person to observe. Would that be, with the Tesla network app, would that be early part of the year? 2021, is that the hope?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 224, "phrase": "If described as a hope, I would say that’s probably a fair description."}, {"author": "Gene Munster", "serial_number": 226, "phrase": "Okay. And then kind of take it to its end stage, the robo taxi stage. Any high level thoughts, understand the regulatory is a massive unknown, but if you’re going to put a guess on it, where would we start when we started seeing robo taxis?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 228, "phrase": "I think it’s quite likely in my view, [Danek 00:52:10] would say-"}, {"author": "Gene Munster", "serial_number": 230, "phrase": "Robo taxi stage. Any high level thoughts, understand the regulatory is a massive unknown, but if you’re going to put a guess on it, where would we start seeing robo taxis?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 232, "phrase": "I think it’s quite likely, in my view, Danek would say I could be wrong, as you’ve seen [inaudible 00:52:38] we are ahead in some areas and we’re behind in others. Because when I give a guess, I give the guess that I think is the likely mid point, not the point with lots of margin. If this is normal distribution, I’d give you the 50th percentile, not the [inaudible 00:08:02], optimistic or pessimistic. So then that really means at least half my predictions will be wrong and half will be right. Or might be right but offset by a few weeks to a few months, in some cases a few years. But I believe everything I’ve ever said would come true, did come true. It may come true late, but it did come true."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 234, "phrase": "So punctuality is not my strong suit, but I always come through in the end. So I think we could see robo taxis in operation with network fleet next year. Not in your market, but it’s been in some."}, {"author": "Moderator", "serial_number": 236, "phrase": "Thank you. Now let’s go with the last question please."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 238, "phrase": "The last question will come from Pierre Ferragu with New Street. Please go ahead."}, {"author": "Pierre C. Farragu", "serial_number": 240, "phrase": "Hey, thanks for taking my question. One on gross margin first, and your [inaudible 00:54:07] in Q1. So there are three moving parts that they went from credits of course, the model Y ramping, even if it broke even, it probably took average cost margin down. And of course you had like Fremont being closed, shut down the last week of the quarter. It probably was this sort of an extra cost. And so when I looked at how gross margin evolved sequentially excluding these three moving parts, I felt like your auto gross margin could have been up a couple of points sequentially. So I wanted to check with you, if that estimate would make sense? And then I would have it for the energy storage. Thank you."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 242, "phrase": "Yeah. So the three things that you mentioned, it’s been a little bit of a hard time hearing the full question here because we’re having a bit of network difficulty in the room but I’ll do my best here. So when we look at margin, we do exclude credits as you have. So I agree with that model. Y ramping, bringing down overall gross margin. I agree with that as well, so it was lower than the overall average. And that will increase Y. And Fremont also weighed on margin and the Shanghai margin was below the average as well. Even though it’s increasing quickly and approaching model three, it’s still below the average. And so I think the sentiment of your question was if you were to remove those factors, was there a sequential increase in gross margin? I haven’t specifically calculated that, but I think your intuition is right."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 244, "phrase": "We saw a strengthened gross margin across the board as I mentioned, and in particular SNX gross margins continue to improve despite slightly lower volumes there and higher fixed cost limitation. So there’s good progress happening both on the ASP side and the cost reduction side for our products and production. And I think this also lends itself to the power of the gross profit contribution to the company. Once we get through these ramping efficiencies, we get Fremont up and running again. We increase capacity so we can spread out fixed costs and continue to execute on cost reductions on our products, and so we’re very optimistic about that path going forward."}, {"author": "Pierre C. Farragu", "serial_number": 246, "phrase": "Thanks and I had a quick follow up on energy storage, if you can hear me well. I think I can’t remember, I think from the very first days I heard you on the calls, you’ve always mentioned that demand for energy storage is always outstripping supply and you have more orders than you can make, and so I’m kind of thinking there should be an inflection point in that business at some point and it’s going to be driven by your ability to add much more manufacturing capacity, like battery manufacturing capacity. And at the high level, how are you thinking about that inflection point in terms of timeline."}, {"author": "Drew Baglino ", "serial_number": 248, "phrase": "In terms of timeline, I think what we’ve been doing with both our partners and internally is looking at how to reduce, fundamentally, the cost of investments in new cell capacity. Because when you look at a car, a vehicle product, there’s a lot of things in the vehicle besides the cells. When you look at an energy storage product, it’s really just the cells. And so to really grow the energy storage business, it’s all about cell investments. And so that’s what we’ve been focused on. And I think, not to give too much away, but that’ll be one of the things we address in battery and investor day is how we’re focused on that. And when we have that in the place we want, it’ll be a lot easier to scale that business."}, {"author": "Moderator", "serial_number": 250, "phrase": "Thank you very much for all your great questions. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have today and we’ll speak to you again in three months time. Thank you very much and have a good day."}]}

Our Q4 results were announced at about 1:00 PM Pacific time in the update deck we published at the same link as these webcasts. During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with FTC."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 4, "phrase": "During the question and answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one followup. Please press star one now if you’d like to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 6, "phrase": "Thanks, Martin. Q4 was another strong quarter for the company. Deliveries reached over 112,000 vehicles in a single quarter. It’s hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with zero advertising spend. We do say that from time to time, and I think it’s often overlooked, but to have the highest demand electric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is, I think, quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without a bunch of advertising."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 8, "phrase": "At our Fremont factory, we were producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record year of 2006. And obviously we expect to exceed that significantly this year. This greater production was achieved before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont. So there’s a lot of potential to go beyond that number."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 10, "phrase": "Well, the Shanghai factory, I’d like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching Model 3 last quarter and achieving their first deliveries earlier this year. I’m really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory. I think it’s going to be an incredible asset to the company. And we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai. So a lot of good progress there."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 12, "phrase": "Regarding Model Y, it was only 10 months ago that we revealed the Model Y prototype, and now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already. This was thanks to a great effort of our engineering team. And we managed to achieve by far the highest energy efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced, at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y all-wheel drive got an EPA rating of 315 miles. This improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today. This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin. And just with great acceleration and top speed, it’s really just incredible specs all around."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 14, "phrase": "For the Cybertruck, a few months ago we revealed the Cybertruck. That went viral, and we’ve tried to build a product that is superior in every way without any preconceptions of how such a product should look. So it really just, from the standpoint of what’s the most bad ass futuristic armored personnel carrier that kicks ass of any pickup truck, basically that’s the goal. And we wanted it to look like something that just kind of came out of a sci-fi movie set from the future."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 16, "phrase": "And the demand has been incredible. I’ve never seen actually such a level of demand at this… we’ve never seen anything like it, basically. I think we’ll make about as many as we can sell for many years. We’ll sell as many as we can make. It’s going to be pretty nuts. And I think actually the product is better than people realize even. They don’t even have enough information to realize just the awesomeness of it. It’s just great."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 18, "phrase": "And then stepping back, in 2018, from a financial standpoint, where free cashflow rate the breakeven. But in 2019, we managed to generate more than a billion dollars of free cashflow while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y in production. So I think, first, to have this level of free cashflow while making massive investments in capacity, while developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the incredible performance of the Tesla team. And I’m just so proud to work with such a great team."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 20, "phrase": "I’d like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control, and that’s what has allowed us to get to these compelling financial numbers while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace. In conclusion, when I think of what we have in front of us the next couple of years, we’ve got Model Y. We’ve got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass roof, Cybertruck, some very exciting improvements in battery technology, full self-driving. We’ve got the next-gen Roadster and a bunch of other products we’ll come up with [inaudible 00:06:30] as well at the same time growing company at an incredible pace."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 22, "phrase": "In conclusion, when I think of what we have in front of us the next couple of years, we’ve got Model Y. We’ve got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass roof, Cybertruck, some very exciting improvements in battery technology, full self-driving.

It’s hard to think of another company that has a more exciting product and technology roadmap."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 24, "phrase": "So super fired up about where Tesla will be in the next 10 years. If you look back 10 years from today to 2010, we will produce approximately 1,000 times more cars in 2020 than we produced in 2010, 1,000. And we have also Solarglass and Solar Retrofit and Powerwall, Powerpack, all those other things too. So where will we be in 10 years? Very exciting to consider the prospect."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 26, "phrase": "Thank you very much, Elon. And Zach has some opening remarks as well."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 28, "phrase": "Yeah, thanks, Martin. This past year was truly transformational for Tesla, and I want to thank everyone who’s been a part of making this happen. On 2019, a few key points I’d like to highlight. On demand, while we’ve mentioned this a few times, it’s worth highlighting once again. Over the course of the year, we’ve transitioned entirely from generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand. We’ve also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs, even increasing slightly in Q4. And we’ve seen an increase in ASPs of FNF, after the launch of the longer range versions in Q2."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 30, "phrase": "With respect to capacity expansion, we’ve greatly learned from the development and launch of Model 3 in Fremont and Reno. As a result, we’ve been able to bring new production capacity onboard faster and with less cost. This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai, as well as Model Y in Fremont. Programs that were both launched in under one year."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 32, "phrase": "Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled through higher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management and continued improvement in our product and operational costs. And we were able to achieve positive gap net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cash generation."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 34, "phrase": "We’ve also made progress on recurring and software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app. Finally, on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by 82 million, driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant. This is a result of our improved expected financial performance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied to."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 36, "phrase": "As we look ahead to 2020, this again will be an important year for the company. Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth while managing cashflows to support that growth. On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter, and we’ll ramp over subsequent quarters. As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model 3."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 38, "phrase": "This year, for the Shanghai-built Model 3, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates. In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of planned supply chain localization at the factory or in the region. This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site. We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally built Model 3 and remained focused on continuing the production ramp and managing costs. We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin-built Model Y, which will result in continued increases in capital spending."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 40, "phrase": "On operating expenses, I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and international footprint. However, op-ex growth should increase at a lower rate than top-line revenue. Overall, we believe this will set us up for our strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted cashflows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 42, "phrase": "For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality. Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products, Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins. We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the coronavirus. At this point, we’re expecting a one to one-and-a-half week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown. This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited, as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 44, "phrase": "We are also closely monitoring whether there’ll be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont. So far, we’re not aware of anything material, but it’s important to caveat that this is an evolving story. However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans while further strengthening the balance sheet. Thank you again for your support, and we will turn to questions."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 46, "phrase": "Thank you. We are going to take the first questions from retail investors compiled by Say Technologies. So the first retail investor question is: Since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass roofs from any of the large California home builders that you can share? What’s the 2020 targets for the number of Solarglass roof installations in California?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 48, "phrase": "We are seeing, admittedly from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for the Solarglass roof. So it’s difficult to predict what that will be this year, except that the demand is very strong. And we are working also, not just through Tesla installers, but also through new home builders and through just the roofing industry in general, where there’s in North America on the order of four million new roofs per year. So we see a lot of interest."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 50, "phrase": "So it’s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the installation. But over time, I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to use Solarglass in one form or another. It’s really going to be a choice of do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without. I think people will want a live roof that generates power and looks good and lasts a long time, and it’s the future we want. So it will be a significant product, but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product, and there’s a lot of challenges to overcome. But they will be overcome, and this will be a major product line of Tesla. And the Buffalo factory is doing great."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 52, "phrase": "Thank you. Now, second question from retail shareholders is: Will you release the Tesla ride-hailing network app before full autonomy and change the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be drivers on the network? If so, when will this happen? Might want to target California airports first, also a good place to add Superchargers."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 54, "phrase": "Sorry, that sounds like more question than one."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 56, "phrase": "Yeah, it’s a bit of a bundle, yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 58, "phrase": "Well, I think it probably will make sense to enable car-sharing in advance of the giant robotaxi fleet because the car-sharing can be done before a full self- driving is approved by regulators. So it’s probably something that we would enable before the full robotaxi is enabled. And it sounded like there were some other questions bundled in there."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 60, "phrase": "Superchargers at airports."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 62, "phrase": "Oh, sure. Yeah, probably will have Superchargers in airports. Will have Superchargers wherever we see that there is a need for Superchargers."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 64, "phrase": "And then on the insurance part of the question, it is our intent to allow people to put their cars into ride-sharing or the FSD network using Tesla Insurance. That’s not currently the case, but by the time that this is available, it’s our intent to get that ready."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 66, "phrase": "Yeah, thank you. The next question from retail investors is: How many California owners are currently insured with Tesla Insurance? What’s the target for Tesla Insurance in 2020? When will you start to significantly leverage the data you have from the fleet to lower the cost of your coverage? Will we get premium discount of certain percent?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 68, "phrase": "Yeah, I mean, go ahead, Zach."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 70, "phrase": "Yeah, so Tesla Insurance is currently available in California. A couple of things that we’re working on on this front, the first is to expand it to other locations. And we are preparing our processes to go through the regulatory processes in those location. We’re also working on the processes to continue to adjust our rates in California, which also have to go through regulatory processes as insurance is quite heavily regulated. And that’s where we’re spending our time focusing on Tesla Insurance right now. There’s a significant amount of innovation as we’ve discussed before in this space. Exactly getting to the intent of what the question here is, using our technology to reduce rates. And this will be rolled in over time."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 72, "phrase": "The last part of the question was will there be a discount for using autopilot with our cars?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 74, "phrase": "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There will be."}, {"author": "Zachary Kirkhorn", "serial_number": 76, "phrase": "The rate card for California Tesla Insurance already considers the safety features associated with autopilot."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 78, "phrase": "Right. But I think it would make sense for us to close the loop on higher use of autopilot fully reduces the insurance cost. It lowers the probability of injury. So I think insurance is going to be, I think, quite a major product of Tesla over time. The amount of money that people spend on car insurance is a remarkably big percentage of the cost of a car. You can lease a Model 3 right now for $400 a month, but a typical owner in California will be paying somewhere between 100 and $200 a month in insurance. So we’re talking about something which is maybe a quarter to half of the cost of the lease of the car is insurance."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 80, "phrase": "And a lot of that insurance cost is just because the insurance companies don’t have good information about the drivers. And that there’s no good way to provide feedback where… it’s a very poor feedback mechanism, not in terms of insurance rates versus the actual way that the car is being driven. Whereas we can do that in real time. It’s a fundamental information advantage that insurance companies don’t have."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 82, "phrase": "Thank you. The next question is: You set expectations that you would be feature complete on FSD by the end of 2019. Can you please provide an update on when will we see this with end users? Where are you in retrofitting the FSD computer to older models?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 84, "phrase": "Well, I mean, to be precise, I said I was hoping we would be complete with FSD by the end of last year. We got pretty close. It’s looking like we might be feature complete in a few months. Feature complete just means it has some chance of going from your home to work with no interventions. So it doesn’t mean the features are working well. It means it has above zero chance."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 86, "phrase": "I think that’s looking like maybe it’s going to be a couple months from now. And what isn’t obvious regarding autopilot and full self-driving is just how much work has been going into improving the foundational elements of autonomy. The core autopilots and Tesla autopilot software and AI team just is, I think, very strong and making great progress."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 88, "phrase": "… very strong and making great progress. We’re really only beginning to take full advantage of the autopilot hardware, the FSD hardware. I think the apparent progress as seen by consumers will seem to be extremely rapid, but actually what’s really gone over my head it seems, like I said, is just having the foundational software be very strong, having a really strong foundation. Then a really fundamental thing is moving to video training. In terms of labeling, labeling with video and all eight cameras simultaneously, this is a really, I mean in terms of labeling efficiency, arguably like a three order of magnitude improvement in labeling efficiency. For those who know about this, it’s extremely fundamental. We’re making great progress on that."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 90, "phrase": "Thank you. The last retail investor question comes from [Kendall 00:00:21:14]. It says, “Most retail investors seem to understand Tesla better than analysts and are risking a larger part of their own personal wealth on Tesla. Doesn’t it make sense to take mostly questions on these earnings calls from us via [inaudible 00:01:29]? Do you even have to take answer questions from analysts?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 92, "phrase": "Well, I guess we don’t have to. I do think that a lot of the retail investors actually have deeper and more accurate insights than many of the big institutional investors and so may have better insights than many of the analysts. It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investor analysts and what some of the smaller retail investors predicted about the future of Tesla, you would probably get the highest accuracy and remarkable insight from some of those predictions."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 94, "phrase": "Okay. Now let’s switch to institutional shareholder questions. The number one question is, “You have spoken previously about Shanghai Giga being 65% lower CapEx per unit of capacity. Have you learned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective? If yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the longterm gross margin?”"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 96, "phrase": "Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 98, "phrase": "Yeah, the Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of cogs for the Model 3 there. We have talked a lot about the capex per unit of capacity being lower, but you can basically run down the entire list of cogs between labor cost and material cost due to localization. It’s opening up suppliers that would not have made economic sense from the States. Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well so we’re not shipping cars from California over to China. Then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs. There’s a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in California and also the Model 3 factory in China. The simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that layout. That cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 100, "phrase": "If you add all of this up, our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model 3 in China relative to Fremont, but I think it’s also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus that we’re selling out of Shanghai is also lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont, from a price perspective. I’ve said this on previous earnings calls, I think it’s fair to expect the margin coming out of the Shanghai facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 102, "phrase": "Yeah. I think there’s a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially the affordable cars, the 3 and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are. It kind of makes sense, but what we’re doing or what happened during the past was really pretty silly in making cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe. This created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars so you’ve got a lot of finished goods sitting on the water or waiting at the port or going through customs. You’ve got tariffs, transport. Then the factory complexity in California is very high because you’ve got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe, sort of three different types of cars that are being built. It’s very complex. Just having a factory in China, a factory in North America, a factory in Europe, just that alone is a massive improvement in our fundamental operating efficiency that I think may not be fully appreciated."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 104, "phrase": "Also on working capital."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 106, "phrase": "Yeah, absolutely."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 108, "phrase": "We’re reducing OpEx here too, not only in China."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 110, "phrase": "The next question from institutional investors is, “Given the recent run in the share price, why not raise capital now and substantially accelerate the growth in production, i.e., build a Giga factory?

If there’s any sensible way to spend money, we are spending it. There’s no artificial hold back on expenditures. Anything that I see that looks like it’s got good value for money, the answer is yes immediately. We’re spending money, I think, efficiently and we’re not artificially limiting our progress. Then despite all that, we are still generating positive cash. In light of that, it doesn’t make sense to raise money because we expect to [inaudible 00:26:52]."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 114, "phrase": "No, I completely agree with that. I think some of our learnings during the Model 3 launch period, where we grew too quickly and with too much complexity, and it held back our ability to continue to scale. Part of the journey that we’ve been on in 2019 is to unwind a series of unintentional bad processes that kind of accumulated in the company over time. That’s kind of what contributes to the reduction in OpEx over the year as we get smarter about that. Now we’ve laid a good foundation, I think. I agree with Elon that we’re not holding back on the growth. I mean, we have two vehicle products launching right now. That will consume much of the bandwidth of the company to stabilize those over the course of the year.

We did see an increase in operating expenses from Q3 to Q4, even excluding the portion of that attributed to stock based compensation. When you double click into that growth, it’s supporting the Model Y program and also a Shanghai program as well. I think we, as a company, are now at the point where we’ve learned a lot on cost efficiency, as I’ve just mentioned, and we’ve unwound a number of the processes that were not in the right place, including automating the things that need to be automated. We’ll continue on that journey, but I think we’re at a point now where OpEx will start to tick up, at least if you look annually from 2019 to 2020, to support our international footprint and then the growth of the company. Our job is to grow that significantly slower than the pace of growth of revenue to improve the operating leverage, which we’re very, very focused on."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 126, "phrase": "Okay.

Our first question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley."}, {"author": "Adam Jonas", "serial_number": 154, "phrase": "Hi, everybody. Actually I agree, I think the retail questions were excellent actually. Elon, do you see potential for Tesla vehicles to be fitted with user terminals that are compatible with the Starlink constellation in the near or medium term future?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 156, "phrase": "Well, it’s certainly something that could be happening in coming years. There’s no plans for it this year. The focus of Starlink is really for high bandwidth, low latency connectivity for homes and businesses and I guess aircraft and boats and that kind of thing, but the antenna for that high bandwidth, low latency thing is sort of about the size of medium pizza, which you could put on a car, but I think is more bandwidth than you would really need. I mean, technically, you could buy one and just stick it on the car. Yeah, it’ll work. I think it’s a great antenna."}, {"author": "Adam Jonas", "serial_number": 158, "phrase": "Maybe just as a follow up for my follow up, how would, assuming that we get the antenna form factor and cost down to a point where that could be integrated into the roof of a car, for example, cost-effectively and aerodynamically, et cetera, how would compatibility with a Starlink architecture theoretically improve the Tesla customer experience or the capability of the network?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 160, "phrase": "Well, I think actually it’s most possible we’ll just use the cellular connectivity, just use 5G would be the recommendation, certainly in like any cities or something like that, but if you’re out in the countryside and there’s not good cell connectivity, then maybe you could connect with the Starlink antenna. You don’t need to like have like gigabit level connectivity. Probably like 20, 30 megabits is probably fine and then you can have a much smaller antenna. Yeah, I guess it could be good for making sure there’s connectivity outside of major cities and that kind of thing, but I mean, that’s sort of, I’d say, relatively obtuse. I’m not thinking about it very much, to be honest."}, {"author": "Martin Viecha", "serial_number": 162, "phrase": "Thank you.

I’m hoping you could give us some guidance on what CapEx is going to be this year. As I look to model out the business longterm, is there a rule of thumb that we can use for capital expenditures per unit of production capacity or some sort of rule of thumb like that?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 168, "phrase": "I don’t think we want to say what our CapEx is going to be this year, not necessarily, except to say like, as I said earlier, we’re spending money as fast as we can spend money in sensible ways. It’s definitely not artificially limited. We will spend a lot of money this year, for sure. The challenge comes in like finding efficient ways to actually deploy the capital, but that’s the harder part than sort of deciding on a CapEx number really."}, {"author": "Speaker 1", "serial_number": 170, "phrase": "I think we always find ways to become more CapEx efficient per unit of capacity."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 172, "phrase": "Yes, exactly.

I think the math … I’m not sure the math that you’ve done, but I think our eternal plans are for faster. Just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on CapEx in the 10K, but back to the growth rate. I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that the Shanghai facility, we do have a loan facility in place to support that growth, so that helps. Then as our production volumes increase, that generates more cash from the business as well that allows us to continue to fund additional factories. I wouldn’t necessarily view it as limited as you described it."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 190, "phrase": "Yeah, I think a few years ago I said I … Yeah, I don’t know when it was, but years ago I just said my estimate is that Tesla would grow at an average rate of in excess of 50%.

The thing we’re going to be really focused on is increasing the battery production capacity, because that’s very fundamental, because if you don’t improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting [inaudible 00:39:19] from one part to another, and you haven’t actually produced more electric vehicles. That’s probably the reason why we have not, for example, really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells. Unless we’ve got a lot of battery cells available, then say like accelerating production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making fewer Model 3 or Model Y cars. We’ve got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in that battery production and continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour for the batteries. This is very-"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 200, "phrase": "Cost per kilowatt-hour for the batteries. This is very fundamental and extremely difficult. So there we’re going to do kind of a battery day, just to kind of explain more about this and what our plans are.

So you know, tentatively, sort of in the April timeframe, what we’ll do is do a battery day and kind of go through what the challenges are, you know?

I want to talk about the differences between the Model 3 and the Model Y, beyond the sort of 10% rule of thumb just around cargo and size. Are there other features that are going to differentiate the two models? And then, as a follow onto that, you’ve talked in the past about how [inaudible 00:43:00] sales grew with the introduction of Model X. So are you planning on setting up your production facilities to align with that thesis, that essentially Model 3 sales will expand alongside the introduction of Model Y?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 216, "phrase": "We’re not quite sure what’s going to happen, but it is true that the instruction Model X actually increased Model S sales, because people would come in, they’d look at the Model X, and they’re like, ” Okay, I’d prefer the sedan.” And we’re worried that X sales would cause S sales to drop. They actually closed the increase. So from my standpoint, I… We’re not too worried about demand, we’re worried about production. Just make sure we get that production ramp going, and reach volume production as soon as possible with the Model Y. And talk to the… [inaudible 00:43:58] predict what that… The exponential part of the S-curve of production, the production pretty much always follows this S-curve, or it’s kind of a herky-jerky S-curve."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 218, "phrase": "And you can use it to predict what it’s going to be like in the beginning because it’s slow, and it’s used to predict what it’s going to be like at the end.

And that high margin part comes from autonomy. So do people buy the full self-driving package or not, and do they buy it worldwide or only in certain places? For example, our autonomy is not as good in China as it is in the U.S., so fewer people, or a very small percentage of people, buy the FSD package in China. But as we fix that, then we’ll see a much higher percentage of people buying it. And as we get closer to full self-driving, that’s just going to become more and more compelling. So that’s, from a financial standpoint, that’s the real mind blowing situation is high volume, high margin, because of autonomy."}, {"author": "Colin Rush", "serial_number": 244, "phrase": "Okay. And then, just shorter term, there’s significant discussion in the industry around moving to higher voltage on the powertrain and then some challenges around the supply chain’s preparedness to support that. Separate from the battery pack, since we’ll talk about that in a couple of months, can you speak to the areas of focus on powertrain technology-driven cost reduction over the next 12 to 24 months that we should be thinking about?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 246, "phrase": "Well, our powertrain is pretty damn good. I mean it’s way better than anything else out there by a country mile. It’s worth noting, for example, that the Model S has a 100-kilowatt-hour pack. The Taycan has a what, like 95-kilowatt-hour pack. The Model S is steadily approaching 400 miles of range. The Taycan has 200 miles of range. So we must be using that energy pretty efficiently, and the powertrain is a big part of that."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 248, "phrase": "I would just say the focus is on costs on the powertrain. One more thing about technology innovations, it’s how do we continue to drive the cost down?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 250, "phrase": "Yeah."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 252, "phrase": "And that’s through voltages. Maybe one angle, but there are certainly others that just enable more power density and lower cost."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 254, "phrase": "Upside? Powertrain is mind blowing, I think. Yeah."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 256, "phrase": "Coming out later this year, end of the year probably, that’s our goal. Get the powertrain out, end of the year, and then it’s going to be like, “This is like alien technology.” It’s insane."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 258, "phrase": "It’s all about that."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 260, "phrase": "I didn’t even think we could do… Yeah, I mean honestly I thought it was no way. But it’s kick ass. It’s engineering team. Just tells a little about hardcore engineering."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 262, "phrase": "Great. Let’s go to the next question please."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 264, "phrase": "Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank."}, {"author": "Emmanuel Rosner", "serial_number": 266, "phrase": "Hi, good evening, everybody. So, in your slide deck you had the comments around average selling price being stable or thereabouts in 2020. Can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes [inaudible 00:49:53] the metric evolve? Obviously you have the Model Y which probably would have initial higher pricing, and then, but the China Model 3’s at a lower price. So, I guess, what are the puts and takes for what you would see as sort of like stability [inaudible 00:50:08] in 2020?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 268, "phrase": "[crosstalk 00:50:11] Yeah, but we don’t really ever comment on prices and stuff. I think we’ll adjust according to what the demand looks like. I mean, right now, it looks pretty good. Maybe that’ll change, who knows? Yeah."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 270, "phrase": "But I think the way you described it is fair. So I mean, relative to the current Model 3, China Model 3 pricing is slightly lower, and our Model Y pricing is public on the website. So you can see that it’s clearly slightly higher than what Model 3 is out of Fremont. How the mix of those three products, and that’s out over the course of the year, we’ll see. But I think it’s probably fair at the moment to assume the mix of those stays fairly stable in terms of ASP when you average them together."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 272, "phrase": "Yeah. I mean, the affordability of our car in China improved radically because of tariffs mostly going away, which is tax exemption, local parts supply. Not having to spend a bunch of money to transport it over the ocean. So the affordability was night and day for our car in China."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 274, "phrase": "Thank you. Let’s go to the next question, please."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 276, "phrase": "Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Ledy with Credit Suisse."}, {"author": "Dan Ledy", "serial_number": 278, "phrase": "Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. Just want to follow up on the question on capital raise. So given the cheaper cost of capital, and this is a real competitive advantage for others, why wouldn’t it make sense to raise capital to either pay down debt or to pursue acquisitions? Especially bolt-ons that could help you accelerate capabilities in autonomous or battery technology."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 280, "phrase": "All right. If you know of any acquisitions, we’d love to hear about them. Yeah, sure. Sounds great. Who should we acquire?"}, {"author": "Dan Ledy", "serial_number": 282, "phrase": "Well, given the importance of autonomous, I imagine that this is an area that you would want to accelerate if you view it as a crucial competitive advantage."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 284, "phrase": "We’re not aware of anyone that we’d want to acquire."}, {"author": "Dan Ledy", "serial_number": 286, "phrase": "And debt paydown?"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 288, "phrase": "Letting the company to pay down debt doesn’t sound like a wise move."}, {"author": "Dan Ledy", "serial_number": 290, "phrase": "Okay. Yeah."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 292, "phrase": "I think the broader… There’s been a couple of versions of this question over the course of the call, and I think what we’re saying more broadly is that, as we look forward on the cash generation from the business relative to what our plans are, we are not constrained."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 294, "phrase": "Yeah. We’re going to pay down the debt, just as time goes by, and we paid down half a billion dollars worth of debt last quarter. So we’ll just keep steadily paying it down, and yeah. So…"}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 296, "phrase": "But yeah, I don’t think we have anything more to say on that front, really."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 298, "phrase": "Okay. Thank you. Let’s go to the next question, please."}, {"author": "Speaker 2", "serial_number": 300, "phrase": "Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Farrago with New Street Research."}, {"author": "Pierre Farrago", "serial_number": 302, "phrase": "Hey, thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to come back on batteries and if I look at the end of this year, you should have [inaudible 00:53:36] and then you have your [inaudible 00:53:47] It means you need plenty north of 16 gigawatt-hour of battery production capacity. So where do you stand now and how do you get there? And then it [inaudible 00:53:58] like your competitors or groups who would like to compete, because you seem to be struggling to grow a battery capacity. So if you can just take us through what you’re doing differently. Why you have confidence you can do that if it looks like nobody has done."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 304, "phrase": "Well, I guess a lot of people sort of made fun of us for not being able to grow both cars and both capacity and it’s like now it turns out actually even the pros have trouble with it. You know, it’s pretty hard. So you know, but the fact is we’ve already demonstrated massive growth and cell production capacity at our Gigafactory in Nevada, and you have to go from the cells to the modules to the pack. So they’ve started at cell capacity but also module and impact capacity. So we’ve just gotten pretty good at that, and it worked well with [inaudible 00:55:03] like Panasonic how’s our relationship has been, it’s been excellent. They’ve been a great partner with us for many years. We’ve added some additional partners at a smaller scale."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 306, "phrase": "We are with LG and CATL, and I will have more to talk about the Sindh detail on the battery day. Like I said, probably April. We’ve got a very compelling strategy. I mean, we are super deep on cell, and cell through battery. So. So module battery. [inaudible 00:55:40] anything you want to add to that?"}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 308, "phrase": "Thanks, but you’ve said it all."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 310, "phrase": "We are super deep. Rabbit holes. That rabbit hole goes down pretty far seven days a week working out its own days, weekend after production. Man, do we know a lot about batteries. Geez."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 312, "phrase": "I think I can see that. The only thing that I would add is, you know we, we do have a decade plus of experience of not just what a cell should be, but how to integrate it into the product and that’s really helped."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 314, "phrase": "Yeah, absolutely. And how to manage those, the cell and the module and the battery and through different weather conditions and different environmental and different charge regimes and wow, we really know a lot about batteries. Yeah. The next level."}, {"author": "Pierre Farrago", "serial_number": 316, "phrase": "Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Maybe a quick, [inaudible 00:56:37] for you, you guys arrived. Can you give us a sense of the impact of the rent of Shanghai on your [inaudible 00:56:43]?"}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 318, "phrase": "yeah, we were negative stress margin on the products that we built in Q4, but the team in China, I think, did a great job managing costs during the launch, and so there was a slight drag associated with it but not terribly significant."}, {"author": "Drew", "serial_number": 320, "phrase": "Okay, and let’s go through the last question please."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 322, "phrase": "Thank you. Our last question will come from Joseph Osha with JMP Securities."}, {"author": "Joseph Osha", "serial_number": 324, "phrase": "Further to the conversation around the cell technology… I was just wondering if you can comment on what the plans are for the Maxwell technology that you acquired, either as a capacitor or dry cell or what have you. Thanks."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 326, "phrase": "Well, like I said, we’re going to talk about this on battery day, which is probably April, and then a lot of these questions will be answered. I think it’s going to be a very compelling story that we have to present. I think it’s going to actually blow people’s minds. It blows my mind and, you know, I know it. So it’s going to be pretty cool."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 328, "phrase": "Maxwell’s… Maxwell, that ultra cap technology is kind of part of the plan."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 330, "phrase": "It’s an important piece of the puzzle. Yes. I think some of this, those sort of retail investors have managed to put together several pieces of the puzzle. They seem to have the most insight."}, {"author": "Joseph Osha", "serial_number": 332, "phrase": "I shall have to read the blogs more. Thank you."}, {"author": "Elon Musk", "serial_number": 334, "phrase": "All right, you’re welcome."}, {"author": "Speaker 3", "serial_number": 336, "phrase": "Thank you very much for everyone, for all of your good questions, and we will speak to you in another three months.
