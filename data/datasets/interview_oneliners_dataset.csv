phrase
Here we go again.
Thank you.
That’s for sure.
Yeah.
"Yeah, and he was born on May the fourth."
Yeah.
"Yes, exactly."
Hopefully.
I sure hope so.
Yes.
"First of all, my partner is the one that actually mostly came up with the name."
"Yeah, yeah."
She’s great at names.
"I mean it’s just X, the letter X, and then the ae is like pronounced ash."
"Yeah, and then eight, 12 is my contribution."
"Archangel 12, the precursor to the SR71."
Coolest plane ever.
True.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
The SR71 came from a CIA program called Archangel.
It’s the Archangel project.
It’s pretty great.
"Actually, I think it’s better being older and having a kid."
I appreciate it more.
"Yeah, babies are awesome."
They’re awesome.
Yeah.
"Yeah, little love bugs."
Yeah.
Great.
Wonderful.
It’s great.
But babies are awesome.
"Yeah, it’s great."
Yeah.
"Also, I’ve spent a lot of time on AI and neural nets and so you can sort of see the brain develop, which is … An AI neural net is trying to simulate what a brain does, basically."
You can sort of see it learning very quickly.
"You know, it’s just wow."
I’m talking about an actual baby.
"Yes, but the word neural net comes from the brain."
It’s like a net of neurons.
Humans are the original gangster of the neural net.
In a lot of ways.
There’s some ways that are different.
"An analogy that’s often used is like we don’t make a submarine swim like a fish, but we take the principles of hydrodynamics and apply them to the submarine."
"I mean, the essential elements of an AI neural net are really very similar to a human brain neural net."
Yeah.
"It’s having the multiple layers of neurons and you know, back propagation."
All these things are what your brain does.
You have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition and then it’ll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place.
It’s interesting.
Very interesting.
"Like I said, there are elements that are the same but just like an aircraft does not fly like a bird."
"It doesn’t flap its wings, but the wings, the way the wings work and generate lift is the same as a bird."
"I’m slightly sad about it, actually."
I think possessions kind of weigh you down and they’re kind of an attack vector.
"They’ll say, “Hey, billionaire, you’ve got all this stuff.” Well, now I don’t have stuff now what are you going to do?"
"No, I said like almost everything, so it’s like …"
"Kind of have to, to test product and stuff."
"You know, there’s things that have sentimental value for sure are keeping those."
"I mean, what’s the worst that could happen?"
"I mean, you’re fine."
I suppose so.
For sure.
"I mean not everyone, but for sure in recent years billionaire has become pejorative like that’s a bad thing."
Which I think doesn’t make a lot of sense in most cases.
If you basically organized a company … How does this wealth arise?
If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before and you have some ownership in that company then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital.
There’s a conflation of consumption and capital allocation.
"Take Warren Buffet, for example, and to be totally frank I’m not his biggest fan, but you know, he does like have full allocation and he reads a lot of annual reports of companies and all the accounting and it’s pretty boring really."
He’s trying to figure out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital?
I mean it’s kind of a boring job if you ask me.
It’s still a thing that’s important to figure out.
"Like, which is a company deserving of more or less capital."
Should that company grow or expand?
Is it making products and services that are better than others or worse?
"If a company is making compelling products and services, it should get more capital and if it’s not, it should get less or go out of business."
"Yeah, for sure."
"I think it’s really, I do think there, in the United States especially, there’s an over allocation of talent in finance and law."
"Basically, too many smart people go into finance and law."
This is both a compliment and a criticism.
"We should have, I think, fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff."
"Yeah, yeah, absolutely."
Manufacturing used to be highly valued in the United States and these days it’s not.
"It’s often looked down upon, which I think is wrong."
Yes.
Somebody’s got to do the real work.
You know?
"Making a car, it’s an honest days living, that’s for sure."
"Making anything, really, or providing a valuable service like providing good entertainment, good information, these are all valuable things to do."
"Yeah, there should be more of it."
"Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it for a while."
"You know, part of it is like I have a bunch of houses, but I don’t spend a lot of time in most of them."
That doesn’t seem like a good use of assets.
Somebody could probably be enjoying those houses and get better use of them me.
I do.
It’s awesome.
Yes.
It’s exactly what you’d expect.
"Yeah, that’s a requirement."
"Yeah, it’ll probably sell for less, but still I don’t care."
And it’s there.
"It’s a real quirky house, yeah."
"I mean, all the cabinets are like handmade and they’re like odd shapes and there’s like doors to nowhere and strange corridors and tunnels and odd paintings on the wall."
Yeah.
It’s very quirky.
"I did live in it briefly, yeah."
"Well, I had one house and the Gene Wilder house is right across the road from me from my main house."
"It was going to get sold and then torn down and turned into, you know, be a big construction zone for three years."
"I was like, whoa, I think I’ll buy it and preserve the spirit of Gene Wilder and not have a giant construction zone."
Then I started having some privacy issues where people would just come to my house and start climbing over the walls and stuff.
"I’m like, man …"
"Then I sort of bought some of the houses around my house and then I thought at one point, well you know, it’d be cool to build a house."
"I acquired some properties at the top of Somera Road, which has got a great view, and I was like, okay, well there’s a bunch of sort of small older houses, they’re going to get torn down, anyway."
"I was like, well, if I collect these little houses then I can build something, I don’t know, artistic like a dream house type of thing."
"Yeah, definitely."
Yeah.
"You got to have the dome that opens up with the stealth helicopter and that kind of thing, you know?"
For sure.
Definitely.
"But then I was like, man, does it really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and I’d be real, you know, ghetto like OCD on the little details and the design, or should I be allocating that time to getting us to Mars?"
I should probably do the latter.
Like what’s more important?
Mars or a house?
I’m like Mars.
Okay.
"Yeah, yeah, definitely."
"I mean, you can only do so many things."
"Right, so how are you going to [crosstalk 00:14:27]"
"Well, I think I do have high productivity, but even with that there’s still some opportunity to [inaudible 00:14:57] time and allocating time to building a house, even if it was a really great house, it still is not a good use of time relative to developing the rockets necessary to get us to Mars and helping solve sustainable energy."
"SpaceX and Tesla are by far, you know, the most amount of brain cycles."
"The Boring Company does not take, you know, it’s like less than 1% of brain cycles."
"Then this neural link, which is, I don’t know, maybe it’s like 5% and then …"
It’s a good chunk.
"Yeah, yeah."
"No, we’re not testing on people yet, but I think it won’t be too long."
I think we may be able to implant a neural link in less than a year in a person I think.
It’s a very low potential for rejection.
"I mean, you can think of it like people put in heart monitors and things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation obviously like artificial hips and knees and that kind of thing."
"The probability of, I mean, so it’s well known what will cause rejection and what will not."
It’s definitely harder when you’ve got something that is sort of reading and writing neurons that’s generating a current pulse and reading current pulses.
"That’s a little harder than say a passive device, but it’s still very doable."
There are people who have primitive devices in their brains right now.
"Well, like deep brain stimulation, I think for Parkinson’s, has really changed people’s lives in a big way, which is kind of remarkable because it kind of like zaps your brain."
It’s like kicking the TV type of thing.
"You think like man, kicking the TV shouldn’t work."
"Yeah, yeah."
It did.
For sure.
Yeah.
"Yeah, so this deep brain stimulation implanted devices in the brain have changed people’s lives for the better like fundamentally."
"Oh yeah, sure, sure."
"Well, for version one of the device, it would be it basically implanted in your skull."
"It would be flush with your skull, so you basically take out a chunk of skull, put the Neuralink device in there."
You’d insert the electrode threads very carefully into the brain and then you stitch it up and you wouldn’t even know that somebody has it.
It can interface basically anywhere in your brain.
"It could be something that helps cure say eyesight, like returns your eyesight even if you’ve lost your optic nerve type of thing."
"Yeah, yeah, absolutely."
"I mean, pretty much anything that it could, in principle, fix almost anything that is wrong with the brain."
"It could restore limb functionality, so if you’ve got an interface into the motor cortex and then an implant that’s like a microcontroller and near muscle groups, you could then create sort of a neural shunt that restores somebody who is a quadriplegic to full functionality."
Like they can walk around and be normal.
"Yeah, maybe slightly better."
"Over time, yes."
"Like the, you know, $6 million man."
Although these days that doesn’t sound like much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well, yeah, the device we’re working on right now is about, it’s about an inch in diameter."
"Your skull is pretty thick, by the way."
"It might actually, literally, I mean if you’re a big guy, your skull is actually fairly thick."
A skull is like seven to 14 millimeters.
A half inch.
Half inch thick skull ish.
"Yeah, yeah, that’s a fair bit of like … We’ve got quite a coconut going on there."
It’s not like some eggshell.
"Yeah, you basically implant the device."
"Yeah, think like a smartwatch or something like that."
"No, but I’d like to."
"Yeah, and you replace that say one inch diameter piece of skull with the Neuralink device and that has a battery and a Bluetooth and an inductive charger."
Then you also insert the electrodes.
The electrodes are very carefully inserted with a robot that we developed.
It’s very carefully putting in the electrodes and avoiding any veins or arteries so it doesn’t create trauma.
"Like tiny wires, basically."
Tiny wires.
"No, you literally put them where they’re supposed to go."
"Yeah, you insert …"
"I mean, they usually go in like, depending on where it is, like two or three millimeters."
Then you put the device in and that replaces the little piece of skull that was taken out.
Then you stitch up the hole and they just look like a little scar and that’s it.
"Yeah, you can totally take it out."
"Yeah, I mean you could for sure, I mean, basically it’s a generalized sort of thing for fixing any kind of brain injury in principle, or if you’ve got like severe epilepsy or something like that."
It could just sort of stop the epilepsy from occurring.
It could detect it in real time and then fire a counter pulse and stop the epilepsy.
"I mean, there’s a whole range of brain injuries."
"Like if somebody gets a stroke, they could lose the ability to speak and that could also be fixed."
If you’ve got like stroke damage or you lose say muscle control over part of your face or something like that.
"When you get older you tend to, if you’ve got like Alzheimer’s or something like that, then you lose memory and this could help you with restoring your memory and that kind of thing."
The thing is it’s like a bunch of circuits and there’s some circuits that are broken and we can fix those circuits.
It’s a substitute for those circuits.
Yeah.
"I mean, there’s still a lot of work to do."
"When I say we’ve got a shot at probably putting in a person within a year, that’s exactly what I mean."
I think we have a chance of putting it into one and having them be healthy and restoring some functionality that they’ve lost.
"I mean, ultimately if you want to go with full AI symbiosis, you’ll probably want to do something like that."
It’s optional.
You wouldn’t need to talk.
"Yeah, I think this is one of the paths to think like what are … Like AI is getting better and better."
Now let’s assume it’s sort of like a benign AI scenario.
"Even in a benign scenario, we’re kind of left behind."
We’re not along for the ride.
We’re just too dumb.
How do you go along for the ride?
"It’s like you can’t beat them, join them."
"We’re already a cyborg to some degree, right?"
"Cause you’ve got your phone, you’ve got your laptop."
"Yeah, yeah."
Your electronic devices.
"Today, if you don’t bring your phone along it’s like you have missing limb syndrome."
It feels like something’s really missing.
"We’re already partly a cyborg or an AI symbiote, essentially it’s just that the data rate to the electronics is slow."
"Especially output, like you’re just going with your thumbs."
I mean like what’s your data rate?
"Optimistically, a hundred bits per second."
That’s being generous.
Now the computer can communicate at like a hundred terabytes.
"Certainly, you know, gigabits are trivial at this point."
"This is like, yeah, basically your computer could do things a million times faster."
At a certain point it’s like talking to a tree.
Okay?
It’s just boring.
You talk to a tree it’s not very entertaining.
"If you can solve the data rate issue and you’re especially output input, too, then you can improve the symbiosis that is already occurring between man and machine."
"Exactly, so when you … Like what happens when you, let’s say you’ve got some complex idea that you’re trying to convey to somebody else and how do you do that?"
"Well, your brain spends a lot of effort compressing a complex concept into words and there’s a lot of loss, information loss that occurs when compressing a complex concept into words."
"Then you say those words and those words are then interpreted, then they’re decompressed by the person who is listening."
"They will, at best, get a very incomplete understanding of what you’re trying to convey."
"It’s very difficult to convey a complex concept with precision because you’ve got compression, decompression, you may not even have heard all the words correctly and so communication is difficult."
What we have here is a failure to communicate.
Cool add Luke.
"Yeah, great on."
Sarcasm is difficult.
You can still do it for sentimental reasons.
"Yeah, exactly."
You don’t need campfire.
Don’t need to roast marshmallows to have fun.
"So, yeah, I think you would, in principle you would be able to communicate very quickly and with far more precision ideas and language would, I’m not sure what would happen to language."
"You could probably in a situation like this, you would be able to just, it’d be kind of like the matrix."
You want to speak a different language.
No problem.
Just download the program.
Sure.
"Well the first few iterations are, what I’m talking about is in the limit over time, with a lot of development."
The first few iterations really in the first few versions all we’re going to be trying to do is solve brain injuries.
"So, don’t worry."
It’s not going to sneak up on you.
This will take awhile.
If the development continues to accelerate then maybe five years.
Five to 10 years.
That’s the best case scenario.
"Best case scenario, but 10 years is more like it."
You could also save state.
Save your brain state like a saved game in a video game.
"Well, hopefully a little better than that."
"But, yeah."
From a [inaudible 00:34:54] perspective probably.
"But yeah, I mean you could save state and restore that state into a biological being if you wanted to in the future in principle, nothing from a physics standpoint that prevents us."
"Now, you’d be a little different, but then you’re also a little different when you wake up in the morning from yesterday and you’re a little different."
"In fact, if you say like you five years ago versus you today is quite a big difference."
So you’d be substantially you.
I mean you’d certainly think you’re you.
I mean the possibilities are endless.
"I mean, just think like how your phone, you can record videos from your phone."
There’s no way you could remember a video as accurately as your phone or a camera could.
"So now if you’ve got like some version 10 Neuralink, whatever and far in the future, you could recall everything, just like it’s a movie."
Including all the entire sensory experience.
Everything.
Everything and play it back and in fact you can edit it.
You could change what you think was your past.
Yeah.
This whole thing right now could be a replayed memory.
There’s no way to assign a probability with accuracy here.
"Well, I don’t have a Neuralink in my brain, so I’d say right now 0%, but at the point at which you do have a Neuralink, then it rises above 0%."
It feels real doesn’t it?
Yeah.
"I’m sure, it should be disconcerting because if this is not real, what is?"
"But, there’s that old sort of thought experiment of like, how do you know you’re not a brain in a vent?"
I mean now here’s the thing.
"You are a brain in a vent, then that vat is your skull."
"Everything you see, feel, hear, everything, all your senses are electrical signals, everything."
Everything is an electrical signal to a brain in a vent with a vat as our skull.
Absolutely.
"Yet, here’s another sort of interesting idea, which is, because you say like where did consciousness arise?"
"Well, assuming you believe the belief in physics, which proves to be true, then the universe started off as basically quarks and leptons and it quickly became hydrogen and helium, lithium, basically elements of the periodic table."
But it was mostly hydrogen basically.
"Then over a long period of time, 13.8 billion years later that hydrogen became sentient."
What’s the line of consciousness and not consciousness between hydrogen and here?
Yeah.
I saw that one.
It went viral.
The one that just dragged the baby down the street pretty far?
There’s definitely some degree of consciousness there.
"Well, I hope consciousness propagates into the future and it gets more sophisticated and complex and that it understands the questions to ask about the universe."
"I mean, you don’t always improve, but you can aspire to improve or you can aspire to be less wrong."
"This is like, I think the tools of physics are very powerful."
Just assume you’re wrong and your goal is to be less wrong.
"I don’t think you’re going to succeed every day in being less wrong, but if you’re going to succeed in being less wrong, most of the time you’re doing great."
You can still have a campfire.
Yeah.
Sure.
I think so.
Yeah.
I like campfires.
We’ll communicate.
It’s clever compression of a concept and a feeling.
"Yeah, absolutely."
I like electronic music.
"Yeah, I mean I hope the future is more fun and interesting and we’re just trying to make it that way."
"We might lose a little, but hopefully we gain more than lose."
It’s not for sure.
Yeah.
"I mean you look at civilization through the ages, most of them they rose and fell."
"I do think the globalization that we have, sort of like the meme sphere, is there’s not enough isolation between countries or regions."
"It’s like if you get, if there’s a mind virus that that mind virus can infect too much of the world."
"I actually sort of sympathize with the anti-globalization people, because it’s like, man, we don’t ever want everywhere to be the same for sure."
Then we need some kind of mind viral immunity.
So that’s a bit concerning.
"No, I’m talking about like somebody, some cockeyed concept that happens right now."
"Well, when I’m talking about a mind virus, I’m talking about a concept that infects people’s minds."
Yeah.
It’s just wrongheaded idea that goes viral in an idea sense.
"Well, I mean it’s the kind of thing where your productivity would improve, I don’t know, dramatically, maybe by a factor of 10 with it."
"So you could definitely just, I don’t know, take out a loan and do it and earn the money back real fast."
Be super smart.
"Well, it’s not a super huge concern."
I mean there are huge differences in cognitive ability and resources already.
You can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective that’s far smarter than an individual.
I couldn’t personally build a whole rocket and the engines and launch it and everything.
That’s impossible.
"But we have 8,000 people at SpaceX and you’re piecing it out to different people and using computers and machines and stuff."
"We can make lots of rockets launch into orbit, dock with the space station and that kind of thing."
So that already exists where those corporations are vastly more capable than an individual.
"But we should be, I think less concerned about relative capabilities between people and more like having AI be vastly beyond us and decoupled from human will."
Super sentient to AI.
"Yeah, like beyond a level that’s difficult to understand and impossible to understand probably."
It’s not a requirement.
It’s just if you want to be along for the ride then you need to do some kind of symbiosis.
"So the way your brain works right now, you’ve got kind of like the animal brain, reptile brain, kind of like the lymphic system basically."
You’ve got the cortex.
"Now the brain purist will argue with this definition, but essentially you’ve got the primitive brain and you’ve got the sort of smart brain or the brain that’s capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey can’t understand."
"Now your cortex is much, much smarter than your lymphic system."
"Nonetheless, they work together well."
So I haven’t met anyone who wants to delete their lymphic system or their cortex.
People are quite happy having both.
"So you can think of this as being like the computer, the AI is like a third layer, a tertiary layer."
So that could be symbiotic with the cortex.
"It’d be much smarter than the cortex, but you essentially have three layers and you actually have that right now."
Your phone is capable of things and your computer is capable of things that your brain is definitely not.
"Storing terabytes of information perfectly, doing incredible calculations that we couldn’t even come close to doing."
You have that with your computer.
"It’s just like I said, the data rate is slow, the connection is weak."
"I don’t think, that’s not how it would be."
Like I said you already are symbiotic with AI or computers.
"Yeah, there’s quite a bit of AI going on, artificial neural nets."
"Increasingly, neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming more and more."
"So you are connected, if you use Google Voice or Alexa or one of those things, it’s using a neural net to decode your speech and try understand what you were saying."
"If you’re trying to do image recognition or improve the quality of photograph, the neural nets the best way to do that."
So you are already sort of a cybernetic symbiote.
"Like I said, it’s just a question of your data rate."
The communication speed between your phone and your brain is slow.
"Yeah, if it works I’ll do it."
Sure.
I mean let’s make sure it works.
"No, like I said, if somebody has got a serious brain injury and people that have very severe brain injuries and then you can fix those brain injuries."
"Then you prove out that it works and [inaudible 00:53:06] expand and make more and more brain injuries, solve more and more."
At a certain age we all are going to get Alzheimer’s or we’re all going to get senile.
Then moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing.
"It’s like you said, okay, well this would allow you to remember your names of your kids and have a normal, a much more normal life where you were able to function much later in life."
So I think essentially almost everyone would find a need at some point if you get old enough to use Neuralink.
"Then it’s like, okay, so we can improve the functionality and improve the communication speed."
So then you will not have to use your thumbs to communicate with the computer.
"Yeah, sure."
I Think about it a lot.
"Like I said, this is not something that’s going to sneak up on you."
Getting FDA approval for this stuff is not overnight.
"I don’t know, we probably have to be on version 10 or something before it would realistically be a human AI symbiote situation."
You’ll see it coming.
Like when?
"Well, assuming civilization is still around, it’s looking fragile right now."
"I think we could have, in 25 years probably I would think there could be a whole brain interface."
Something pretty close to that.
Yeah.
Almost all the neurons are connected to the sort of AI extension of yourself.
If you want.
"Well, like I said, you already have a computer extension of yourself and your phone and computers and stuff."
"So, and now online it’s like somebody dies, there’s like an online ghost that they’re still, their online stuff is still alive."
"Instagram and their stories and yeah, whatever Facebook and stuff."
Yeah.
"So it would just be that more of you would be in the cloud, I guess, than in your body or more of you."
What’s that?
I never heard of it.
I have no idea what you’re talking about.
Sure.
"Well, yeah."
I mean this certainly has taken over the mind space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking.
"Yeah, I mean I kind of saw this whole thing play out in China before it played out in the US."
"So it’s kind of like watching the same movie again, but in English."
"Yeah, I think the mortality rate is much less than what say the World Health Organization said it was."
"It’s much, much less."
It’s like probably at least order of magnitude less.
Yeah.
"I mean, you can look at the mortality statistics by age and whether they have comorbidities, like do they have basically existing conditions and by age."
"If you’re below 60 and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low."
"It’s not zero, but it’s extremely low."
It’s almost like people really wanted a panic.
It’s quite crazy.
Most of the hospitals in the United States right now are half empty.
In some cases they’re at 30% capacity.
Yes.
"I mean, we’re not talking about just some of these elective procedures are quite important."
Like you have a bad heart.
You need a triple bypass.
"It’s sort of elective, but if you don’t get it done in time, you’re going to die."
Elective.
"It’s not like, this isn’t like plastic surgery."
"It’s more like my hip is, I’m in extreme pain because my hip’s blown out or my knee and I don’t want to go to the hospital."
I can’t go to the hospital.
"People are in extreme pain, people that need a kidney, people that have quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear."
So I think it’s a problem that’s not good.
So I think it’s a problem that’s not good.
It is.
Objectively the mortality is much lower.
"At least a factor of 10, maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought."
"Well, I think proper hygiene is a good thing no matter what."
"Wash your hands and if you’re coughing, stay at home or wear a mask because it’s not good."
They do that in Japan.
That’s normal.
If you’re ill you wear a face mask and you don’t cough on people.
I think that would be a great thing to adopt in general throughout the world.
Washing your hands is also good.
Men are disgusting it’s true.
It’s bad.
Yeah.
Just go to the restroom you can see it’s horrible.
True.
And I think that there’s definitely some silver linings here in improved hygiene and-
Yes.
I think this has shaken up the system.
the system is somewhat moribund with lot of layers of bureaucracy and I think that we’ve cut through some of that bureaucracy.
And at some point there probably will be a pandemic with a high mortality rate.
Debate about like what’s high.
"but I mean something that’s killing a lot of 20 year olds, let’s say."
Like if you had Ebola type of mortality.
Yeah.
"Like killing large numbers of young healthy people, to find that as like a high mortality than that."
This is at least practice for something like that.
"And I think there’s this, given it’s just a matter, that there will be eventually some such pandemic."
"Yeah, absolutely."
"And I think there’s a good chance, it’s highly likely, I think, coming out of this that we will develop vaccines that we didn’t have before for coronaviruses, other viruses, and possibly cures for these."
And our understanding of viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it’s received.
So there’s definitely a lot of silver linings here.
Yeah.
I think there will be a massive lining of here no matter what.
Hopefully we can be more of a silver lining than less.
"So yeah, this is just kind of like a practice run for something that might in the future have a serious, like a really high mortality rate and we kind of got to go through this without it being something that kills vast numbers of young healthy people."
That is the exact wording.
"Yeah, of course."
"Well, I mean, I certainly get that."
There’s no shortage of negative feedback on Twitter.
I get it.
It’s a war zone.
Yeah.
"I mean, I scroll through the comments."
"Like I said, it’s a meme war zone."
"I mean, people knife you good and thorough."
Sure.
"I mean, I’ve been in the Twitter war zone for, for a while here, so."
And it takes a lot to phase me at this point.
Yeah.
You can’t take it personally.
A lot of these people don’t actually know you.
"It’s like if you’re fighting a war and there’s like some opposing soldier that shoots at you, it’s not like they hate you."
They don’t even know you.
So just think of it like that.
"Like they have fire and bullets, whatever."
"But they don’t know you, so don’t take it personally."
"Well, there will always be some ambiguity, but tweets, it’s hard."
But maybe there should be like a sarcasm flag or something.
Or a “just kidding” or-
"Wow, that’s amazing."
"Yeah, I think it’s pretty great."
It might be the best news source.
"Is this, like, a female avatar."
"Oh, okay."
I find Twitter quite engaging.
"Well, I mean like five minutes every couple of hours type thing."
It’s not like I’m sitting on it all day.
"Yeah, you have to, like I said, take a certain amount of distance from… You read this and be like, “Okay, it’s bullets being fired by an opposing army.” Like I said, it’s not like they know you."
Don’t take it personally.
Yeah.
That was annoying.
It was wrong.
"Well, yeah."
I don’t think CNN is that.
"Used to be, yeah."
What do you think’s the best source of just information out there?
"Let’s say you’re just the average citizen trying to just get the facts, figure out what’s going on."
How to live your life and just looking for what’s going on in the world.
It’s hard to find something that’s good.
"Not trying to push some partisan angle, not trying to not doing sloppy reporting, and just aim it for the most number of clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars and that kind of thing."
You’re just trying to figure out what’s going on.
"It’s like, I’m hard pressed."
Where do you go?
Yeah.
I think maybe just trying to find individual reporters that you think are good and kind of following them as opposed to publication.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
I’ll check it out.
Now that’s nice.
Yeah.
"I mean, in general I think we should be concerned about anything that’s a massive infringement on us."
Civil liberties.
"So, you got to put a lot of weight on that."
A lot of people died to win independence for the country and fight for the democracy that we have.
And we should treasure that and not give up our liberties too easily.
"And I think we probably did that, actually."
So.
Fundamentally a violation of the constitution.
"Freedom of assembly and it’s just, I don’t think these things stand up in court, really."
Yeah.
These would definitely not stand up if the Supreme court… It’s obviously a complete violation of rights.
Yeah.
"I mean it just should be if you’re at risk, you should not be compelled to leave your house or leave a place of safety, but if you’re not at risk, or if you are at risk and you wish to take a risk with your life, you should have the right to do that."
Yes.
"I mean, there’s a strong downside to this."
"So yeah, I just believe this is a free country."
You should be allowed to do what you want as long as it does not endanger others.
Yeah.
"I think there’s a, as I said, my opinion is if somebody wants stay home, they should stay home."
"If somebody doesn’t want to stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home."
That’s my opinion.
"If somebody doesn’t like that, well that’s my opinion."
"This notion though, that you can just sort of send checks out to everybody and things will be fine is not true."
Obviously several have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty.
Like it just makes stuff.
"There’s just a magic horn of plenty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of plenty."
And then if somebody has more stuff than somebody else it’s because they took more from this magic horn of plenty.
Now let me just break it to the fools out there.
"If you don’t make stuff, there’s no stuff."
Yeah.
"So, if you don’t make the food, if you don’t process the food, you don’t transport the food, medical treatment, getting your teeth fixed, there’s no stuff."
They’ve become detached from reality.
You can’t just legislate money and solve these things.
"If you don’t make stuff, there is no stuff, obviously."
"we’ll run out of the stores, run out of the… the machine just grinds to a halt."
Maybe.
I think briefly.
"Briefly, but I think if any kind of sensible examination of what happened in China would lead you to conclusion that that is obviously not going to occur."
This virus retreated in Wuhan.
"There’s was like, I don’t know, hundred thousand people a day leaving Wuhan."
"So, it went everywhere very fast throughout China, throughout the rest of the world, and the fatality rate was low."
The thing is that American companies have massive supply chains in China.
"Like Tesla, for example."
We have hundreds of suppliers.
"Like tier one, two, three, four suppliers throughout China."
"So, we know if they are able to make stuff or not."
"We know if they, if they have issues or not."
China is back at full steam and pretty much every US company has some significant number of suppliers in China.
So you know if they’re able to provide things or not or if there’s high mortality rate.
"Tesla has like 7,000 people in China."
"So, zero people died."
Zero.
Yeah.
We literally run payroll.
I’m like-
Yeah.
Still there.
"I think this has been politicized in both directions, really."
Which is not great.
Yeah.
But like I said [inaudible 01:25:54] I think there’s the question of where do civil liberties fit in this picture?
"And what can the government make you do, what can they make you not do, and what’s okay?"
And I think we went too far.
Absolutely.
"Well, I think we’re rapidly moving towards opening up the country."
It’s going to happen extremely fast over the next few weeks.
"So, yeah."
Something that would be helpful just to add from an informational level is when reporting Covid cases to separate out diagnosed with Covid versus had Covid like symptoms.
Because the list of symptoms that could be Covid at this point is like a mile long.
"So, it’s hard to, if you’re ill at all it’s like you could recover it."
"So, just to give people better information."
Definitely diagnosed with Covid or had Covid like symptoms.
We’re conflating those two so that it looks bigger than it is.
"Then if somebody dies, was Covid a primary cause of the death or not?"
"I mean, if somebody has Covid, gets eaten by a shark, we find their arm, their arm has Covid, it’s going to get recorded as a Covid death."
Basically.
You get hit by a bus.
"If you get hit by a bus, go to the of the hospital and die, and they find that you have Covid, you will be recorded as a Covid death."
"Well right now, the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"I mean, it’s mostly paved with bad intentions, but there’s some good intentions [inaudible 01:28:37] in there, too."
"And the stimulus bill that was intended to help with the hospitals that were being overwrought with Covid patients created an incentive to record something as Covid that is difficult to say no to, especially if your hospital’s going bankrupt for lack of other patients."
"So, the hospitals are in a bind right now."
"There’s a bunch of hospitals, they’re furloughing doctors, as you were mentioning."
"If your hospital’s half full, it’s hard to make ends meet."
"So now you’ve got like, “If I just check this box, I get $8,000."
"Put them on a ventilator for five minutes, I get $39,000 back."
"Or, I got to fire some doctors.” So, this is tough moral quandary."
"It’s like, what are you going to do?"
That’s the situation we have.
Let’s clear up the data.
Clear up the data.
"So like I said, somebody should be recorded as Covid only if somebody has been tested."
"Has has received a positive, positive Covid test."
"Not if they simply have symptoms, one of like a hundred symptoms."
"And then if it is a Covid death, it must be separated."
"Was Covid a primary reason for death, or did they also have stage three cancer, or heart disease, emphysema, and got hit by bus and had Covid?"
This is not a question.
This is what is occurring.
The public health officials have literally said this.
This is not a question mark.
Yes.
"And like I said, this is not some sort of a moral [inaudible 01:31:07] of hospital administrators."
"It’s just, they’re in it."
They’re in a tough spot here.
They actually don’t have enough patients to pay everyone without furloughing doctors and firing staff.
They’re running potentially going bankrupt.
"So then they’re like, “Okay, well the stimulus bill says we get all this money if it’s a Covid death.” I’m like, “Okay."
"They coughed before they died.” In fact, they’re not even diagnosed with Covid."
"If you had weakness, a cough, shortness of breath."
"Frankly, I’m not sure how you die without those things."
Yes.
"But to be clear, you don’t even need to have gotten a Covid diagnosis."
You simply need to have had one of many symptoms and then have died for some reason and it’s Covid.
"So, then it makes the death count look very high and we’re then stuck in a bind because it looks like the death count’s super high and not going down like it should be."
"So then, we should keep whatever, keep the shelter in place stuff there, and keep people in their homes, confine people to homes."
So we need to break out of this.
We’re stuck in a loop.
And I think the way to break out of this loop is to have clarity of information.
I know a lot of people who got it.
"I know zero people who died, but I know a lot of people that got it."
That is correct.
Just parse out the data.
Don’t lump it all together.
"If you give people, just parse out the data better, clearer information about, like I said, was this an actual COVID diagnosis?"
Did they get the test and the test came back positive or do they just have some symptoms?
"Just parse those two out, and then parse out just, if somebody died, did they even have a COVID test or did they just have one of many symptoms."
How do you die without weakness?
I don’t know.
"It’s impossible, basically."
"If you’re going to die, you’re going to have shortness of breath, weakness and you might cough a little."
"Yeah, did that person, did they actually have a COVID test and the test come back positive?"
"And then if they died, did they die where COVID was… It doesn’t have to be the main cause, but it was a significant contributor to their death or was it not a significant contributor to the death?"
Definitely not.
"I mean, people die all the time and they have like flu and other colds and we don’t say that they died of those flu and other colds."
It’s absurd.
"I mean, every year in the world, several hundred thousand people die directly of the flu."
Not tangentially.
Not every-
Yeah.
And we’re only 5% of the world.
"So, oh man, cigarettes."
Now cigarettes will really kill you.
Yeah.
"I mean, several years ago, or maybe longer, 10 years ago, I helped make a movie called Thank You for Smoking."
Yeah.
"It’s, it’s crazy."
Barbecuing your lungs is just bad news.
It’s not good.
"Turning your lungs into smoked beef, not great."
So yeah.
"Tylenol, by the way, also kills a lot of people."
I’m not sure the exact number.
"But until the opioid crisis, I believe Tylenol was the number one killer of all drugs."
"Because basically, if you get drunk and take a lot of Tylenol, acetaminophen, essentially it causes liver failure."
"So people would like get wasted and then have a headache and then pop a ton of Tylenol, its curtains."
Yeah.
"But nobody’s, raging against Tylenol."
"Yeah, water is really dangerous."
Stop water.
We do.
Nobody lives forever.
"I mean I think, you want to look at say deaths as like the, “but for this disease, whatever, they would have lived X number of years.”"
"So, if somebody dies when they’re 20 and could have lived till 80, they lost 60 years."
But if somebody dies when they’re 80 and they might’ve lived till 81 they lost one year.
"So it’s, “How many life years were lost” is probably the right metric to use."
It’s not true.
Yeah definitely not.
Oh my god.
"Let’s just say, it’s about the same."
Yes.
"I mean actually, I think a lesson to be taken here that I think is quite important is that, if you have your grandparents and that they’re age of grandparents, really be careful with, any kind of flu or cold or something that that is not dangerous to kids or young adults, but is dangerous to the elderly."
"Basically, if your kid’s got a runny nose, they should stay away from their grandparents, no matter what it is."
"There’re things where a young immune system has no problem, an older one has a problem."
"In fact a lot of the deaths are literally, it’s tragic, but they’re, they’re intra-family."
"It’s, the little kid had a cold or flu and they [crosstalk 01:40:31]."
Yeah.
They had the family gathering.
And they don’t know that this is a big deal.
"But it’s just important to remember when you get old, your immune system’s just not that strong."
"And so, just be careful with your loved ones who are elderly."
Yeah.
"Actually, just a thing that is tough."
"As you get older, you tend to put on weight, certainly that’s happening with me."
"The older I get like, “Damn, sure harder to stay lean.” That’s for sure."
"And so, actually, being overweight is a big deal."
It’s a fact.
Yeah.
That’s correct.
"It is, yes, exactly."
Food’s great.
Yeah.
"I mean to be totally frank, I mean, speaking for myself, I’d rather read tasty food and live a shorter life."
No.
"Tasty food is great, it’s one of the best things about life."
Yeah.
"I don’t know what advice to give, maybe having tasty food but smaller amounts of it."
So what?
"Well Okay, yeah."
So like at night or at a certain [crosstalk 01:43:40]
"Actually, this may be a useful bit of advice for people, but eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep."
"And it can actually cause heartburn, that you don’t even know is happening, and that subtle heartburn, it affects your sleep because your horizontal and your body’s digesting."
"So if you want to improve the quality of your sleep and be healthier, it’s do not eat right before we go to sleep."
It’s one of the worst things you could do.
It’s going to crush your sleep and it’s going to damage your pyloric sphincter and your esophagus.
"In fact drinking and then going to sleep, that’s one of the worst things you could do."
So just try to avoid drinking and eating-
"Yeah, exactly."
"Small amounts of alcohol, evidence suggests it doesn’t have a negative effect on-"
Yeah.
"I mean some of the people who’ve lived the longest, there was a woman in France who I think, maybe has the record or close to it, and she had a glass of wine every day."
Small amounts is fine.
"But yeah, I learned this like quite late in life."
"It’s like, just avoid having alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep, and your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot."
"It’s a big deal and I think, not widely known."
A little bit.
"I do, although I haven’t seen him for a while."
"But yeah, especially if I’m out, say we’re working on Starship or something South Texas and I’m just living in my, I got a little house there in Boca Chica village, and I don’t have much to do, so."
Or I’m working and I’ll just lift some weights or something.
"Some people love running, I don’t love running."
But if-
"To be totally frank, I wouldn’t exercise at all if I could."
"I prefer not to exercise, but if I’m going to exercise, I’ll lift some weights and then kind of run on a treadmill and maybe watch a show, if there’s a compelling show that pulls you in."
"Man, don’t watch Black Mirror before going to bed either."
"Yeah, exactly."
"It’s like, “Wait, that’s already happened in real life.”"
It’s too close.
He’s nailed it?
Oh man.
I did martial arts when I was kid.
Liked it.
I did a TaeKwonDo.
"I did Karate, [foreign language 00:14:51] [crosstalk 01:47:52]."
And Judo.
Yeah.
And did Brazilian Jujitsu briefly.
In Palo Alto.
Yeah.
"I mean, I kind of got, probably like a lot of people, for the way-early day, the first MMA fights and Royce Gracie, and he was just like incredible."
And it was like-
Yeah.
He was winning against people way bigger and that kind of thing.
"And it was just like “Whoa, this is cool.”"
Right.
Especially if they know martial arts too.
"It’s like, “Oh no.”"
"Yeah, it was amazing."
I mean Royce got beaten up pretty bad in some of those.
But he won.
"Yeah, totally."
"My kids… I should say, I sent my kids to jujitsu since they were like, I don’t know, six."
[crosstalk 01:50:51].
Yeah.
"Yes, seems like a good… Yeah."
"Well I can’t say exactly when, but we got to get it… This COVID thing’s kind of thrown us for a loop."
"So, not to blame everything on COVID, but it’s certainly set us back on progress for some number of months."
But I mean things were going to get done.
"Ahead of Roadster are, ramping up model Y production, that’ll be a great car, it is a great car, getting the Berlin Giga-factory built, and also building Y getting expanding the Shanghai factory, which is going great and get this Cybertruck, Semi truck, Roadster."
Roadster is kind of like dessert.
We gotta get the meat and potatoes and greens and stuff.
"I mean, I think we should do Cybertruck first, before Roadster."
Now some of the-
"Some of the things for Roadster, the tri-motor, plaid powertrain, we’re going to have that in model S. So that’s like part one of the ingredients that’s needed for Roadster, is the plaid powertrain, the more advanced battery pack."
That kind of thing.
"Sounds good to me, sure."
"Yeah, I mean, go ahead."
Yeah.
I’ve got no problem.
Yeah.
"You could for sure, lighten the car up and improve tire traction and-"
"I don’t know specifically, but there’s-"
Cool.
That looks pretty nice.
"Well, I think we’ve got to leave that for a proper sort of product unveil."
Oh great.
Glad you like it.
Pretty fun.
"Yeah, actually, it’s really quite slow."
"But, okay, sure."
You’ve tried it like Ludicrous Plus and stuff like that?
Yeah.
Cool.
"We just did a software update where it’ll do, like a, cheetah stance."
So yeah.
"So, because it’s got a dynamic air suspension so it lowers the back."
Just like a sprinter basically.
"Like what do you do if you’re a sprinter, you hunker down and then shoo."
So I shaved like a 10th of a second off the 0 to 60.
I mean it’s pretty fun.
And they’ve never felt anything like it.
It’s baffling.
They’ve never felt it.
It’s faster than falling.
"Yeah, pretty fun."
Yeah.
It’s like having your own roller coaster on tap.
"Well with a Roadster, we’re going to do some things that are kind of unfair."
"So we’re going to take some things from Cadillac rocket world and put them on a car, so."
"Well, like I said, we can’t do the product unveil right here."
"But, it’s going to do some things that are unfair."
"When we do the unveil of the Roadster, let me just say that anyone who’s been waiting, they won’t be sorry."
They won’t be sorry.
That’s the base model.
[inaudible 00:01:57:14].
"Faster than that, yeah."
"Well, yeah."
I mean-
"…at least you know that our demos are authentic, because I was not expecting that and then I think I muttered, under my breath, like “Holy shit”."
No-
"No, I definitely swore, I didn’t think the micro pick it up but it did."
"But, so like we practiced this, behind the scenes."
"At Tesla, we don’t do like tons of practice for our demos, because we’re working on the cars."
We’re building new technologies and improving the fundamental product.
"So we’re not spending, doing hundreds of practice things or anything like that."
We don’t have time for that.
"But, just hours before the demo, both Franz, head of design and I were in the studio throwing steel balls at the window, and it’s bouncing right off."
"And like, “Okay, this seems pretty good."
It seems like we got it.” Okay?
"And then, we think what happened was, when Franz hit the door with the sledgehammer-"
"…show, this is exoskeleton, high strength, hardened steel."
"You can literally wind up with a sledgehammer, full on double-handed sledgehammer and hit the door and there’s not even a dent."
It’s cool.
"But we think that cracked the corner of the glass at the bottom and then, once you crack the corner of the glass it’s game over."
So then when you threw the ball that’s what cracked the glass.
It didn’t go through though.
It’s doesn’t go through.
"Yeah, exactly."
"Yeah, I got to get back to it."
"Well, I think you’ve got a great show."
Thanks for having me on.
"Anyway, that should get a little play."
It doesn’t look like anything else.
"So we’ll start off with the size, the dimensions."
And the inspiration.
"So the functionality I’m going to describe is within a space that is less than the most popular pickup truck in the United States, the F150."
"So we didn’t cheat in either width, height, or length, and we’re able to achieve much greater capability in the same dimensions, same weight."
Yeah.
"Part of this is the fundamental design change, we moved the mass to the outside."
We created an exoskeleton.
"So normally the way that a truck is designed, you have a body on frame, you have a bed on frame and the body and the bed don’t do anything useful."
"They’re carried like cargo, like a sack of potatoes."
"It was the way that aircraft used to be designed, when they had biplanes, basically."
The key to creating an effective monoplane was a stressed skin design.
You move the stress to the outside skin.
Allows you to do things that you can’t do with a body on frame.
"So we’re able to make the skin out of thick, ultra hard stainless steel."
It’s really hard.
We’re going to show you just how hard.
So Franz has a sledgehammer.
Now don’t hold back.
Okay.
It’s a regular truck door.
Do it.
"Yeah, hit it a couple times."
"Yeah, nice."
Now hit the Cybertruck.
Same thing.
Hit it harder.
Yeah.
Really wind up and nail it.
Very strong.
"So if you think about a truck, you want a truck that’s tough."
"You want a truck that’s really tough, not fake tough."
You want a truck you can take a sledgehammer to.
A truck that won’t scratch.
It doesn’t dent.
What else can we do with this truck?
What if we shot it?
Let’s shoot it.
"But OSHA, I mean, come on."
That’s a 9mm bullet shot at the door.
"We’re in California, unfortunately."
But the 9mm… It is literally bulletproof to a 9mm handgun.
That’s how strong the skin is.
"So it’s ultra hard, cold rolled stainless steel alloy that we’ve developed."
We’re going to be using the same alloy in the Starship rocket and in the Cybertruck.
"Yeah, you’re welcome."
"So on the right, that’s like normal truck doors that may as well be made of tissue paper."
That looks like a paintball.
Very different.
"So when you say something’s built tough, that’s what we mean."
What about the glass?
Seems like a vulnerability.
"Yeah, transparent metal glass."
"Yeah, that’s right."
Let’s show some of the tests.
What can we do with this?
All right.
Let’s show the glass demo.
There you go.
So first this is regular glass.
"This is like normal glass, car glass."
We’re going to show you what happens with normal car glass.
"Shatters immediately, with the little ball."
Now we’ll show you Tesla armored glass.
Nothing.
"Yeah, it’s kind of a small ball though."
Let’s maybe do it at a bigger height with a… Yeah.
Yeah.
"[inaudible 00:06:55] Yeah, not bad."
A bigger ball.
Yeah.
Not bad.
"Franz, could you try to break this glass please?"
Yeah.
Oh my f***ing God.
"Well, maybe that was a little too hard."
"[inaudible 00:08:08] It didn’t go through, as a plus side."
Try that one?
Really?
Okay.
Sure.
"Aw, man."
It didn’t go through.
All right.
Not bad.
Room for improvement.
All right.
Let’s see.
So yeah.
"We didn’t actually throw everything… We threw wrenches, we threw everything."
We even literally threw the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn’t break.
For some weird reason it broke now.
I don’t know why.
Fix it in post.
"In addition, the car has an adaptive air suspension."
"It’s literally built… Yeah, with adaptive air suspension."
So this will come standard on all the cars.
"I think this is actually a very important design element because if you have a… If every truck has the ability to adjust the ride height so you can go very low or very high, so you can be efficient on the highway and you can also go off-roading."
It’s going to have the highest clearance of any production truck.
So it would have about a 16 inch clearance.
And you can adjust this on the fly.
So it’s adaptive damping and adaptive ride height.
These are actually extremely important for a truck.
"Because trucks when you only drive them, they’re either too cushy or they’re too hard."
You need it to be able to adjust dynamically depending upon what the load is.
"If you’ve got a lot of people on board, if you’ve got a full bed in the back, it’s got to adjust accordingly."
"So yeah, let’s talk about the… We call it the Volt."
Cybertruck Volt.
Let’s look… Let’s demo this active.
Yeah.
"The rear is a hundred cubic feet, six and a half foot length, bed length, up to 3,500 pounds of payload."
Yeah.
And it can tow… But what about a real world test?
Let’s actually have a tug of war here with an F150.
So you can see which one can pull which.
Let’s do the tug of war video.
"I mean, yeah."
It was uphill.
So let’s see.
On-road performance…
"Now let’s see, how does this compare to a Porsche 911?"
"Okay, we’re going to give the Porsche a little bit of a headstart."
Yeah.
This is a current edition Porsche.
And this is the actual truck.
This is not CGI.
"In terms of off road performance, it’s going to have the best angular approach angle, best clearance heights, best departure angle."
"For people that are really going off road, this is going to be great."
You could basically do the Baja Rally in this thing.
We have three ranges.
So yeah.
"So obviously it’ll have access to all the superchargers, be capable of more than 250 kilowatts, we’ll reveal the actual number later, and it has onboard outlets for 110 and 220 volts."
So you don’t need a generator.
The truck literally is your generator.
"And, as a little plus, because it’s got an air suspension, we can tap off the air suspension so you have a pneumatic source."
So you have an… Yeah.
Onboard air compressor.
Of course it will come with autopilot standard.
Yep.
So there’ll be three versions.
But it’s going to… [crosstalk 00:13:48] That’s the price without any incentives.
That’s just like the price without any incentives.
But the actual economics are even better than that because the cost of electricity is much less than the cost of gasoline.
"So when you look at the actual cost of ownership here, it’s… You’re paying much less for electricity than you are for the gasoline."
You’re paying much less for maintenance.
"There’s no oil changes, no smog checks, no nothing, none of that stuff."
"So your maintenance is low, your cost of operations are low."
"And so it’s actually comparable to a truck, a gasoline truck, that’s 10 to $15,000 less."
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
So you can order now if you would like.
Tesla.com/cybertruck.
"Or I should say also, we’re going to be offering rides in this all night."
Don’t mind the glass.
"Anyway, thank you guys for coming."
It’s going to be a great party and you’ll love riding around in this thing.
It’s great.
"All right, thank you."
Oh wait.
We have…
Should we do the… Oh yeah.
"We also made an ATV, so… Let’s bring it out."
So you can see the truck.
This is what I mean by the adaptive air suspension.
"Nice work, by the way."
"So the adaptive air suspension, you can drop real low and go high on the other side with [inaudible 00:17:19] load mode."
"So you’ve got load mode, you’ve got a built-in ramp."
"You can take a ATV or dirt bike, whatever you want, and load it on the back."
Yes.
"Oh, and it’s currently plugged in and charging."
Yeah.
"If you look, the car is adjusting itself."
So you can go like real tight on the freeway and you’re going to go way high off-roading.
Yeah.
All right.
Thank you.
Sure.
"So to recap, Q2, 2021 was the record quarter on many levels."
"We achieved record production [inaudible 00:01:35] , and surpassed over a billion dollars and gap income for the first time in Tesla history."
I’d really like to congratulate everyone at Tesla for an amazing job.
This is really an incredible milestone.
It also seems that public sentiment towards Ev’s is at an inflection point.
"And this point, I think almost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward."
"Regarding supply chain, while we’re making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious."
"For the rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest parts in our supply chain, which is there’s a wide range of chips that are at various times the slowest parts of the supply chain."
"I mean, it’s worth noting that if we had everything else, if we had vast numbers of vehicles in sales, we were not able to make them, if everything except the chips, we would be able to make them."
The chips supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output.
"It’s difficult for us to say how long this will last because we don’t have, this is because out of our control, essentially."
"It does seem like it’s getting better, but it’s hard to predict."
"So in fact, even achieving the output that we did achieve was only due to an immense effort from people within Tesla."
We were able to substitute alternative chips and then write the firmware in a matter of weeks.
It’s not just a matter of swapping out a chip.
You also have to rewrite the software.
"So it was an incredibly intense effort of finding new chips, writing new firmware, integrating with the vehicle and testing in order to maintain production."
"And I also like to thank our suppliers who worked with us and there’ve been many calls, midnight, 1:00 AM just with suppliers, in resolving a lot of the shortages."
So thanks very much to our suppliers.
"Let’s see in terms of epic FST subscription, we were able to launch a full self driving subscription last month and we expect it to build slowly and then, but then gather a lot of [inaudible 00:04:09] over time."
Obviously we need to have the full self-driving [inaudible 00:04:14] widely available for it really to take off at a high rate.
And we’re making a lot of progress there.
"So yeah, I think FSC subscription will be a significant factor probably next year."
"We’ve got two Giga, Texas, and Giga, Berlin, we’re actually doing this earnings call from Giga, Texas."
So we’re in the factory right now doing this earnings call.
And the team has made incredible progress here.
You can see the pictures online and see that there’s basically nothing a year ago and this mostly complete large factory a year later.
"So really, really great work by the Giga, Texas team."
And then also great work in Berlin- Brandenburg with the team there.
So we expect to be producing the sort of new design of the Model Y in both factories in limited production later this year.
"It’s always like, it’s hard to sort of explain to people who have not been through the agony of a manufacturing ramp."
"Like, why can’t you just turn it on and make 5,000 a week."
"This is, it is so hard to do manufacturing."
It is so hard to do production.
"First approximation, there are thousand unique parts and processes that have to work."
"And the greater growth of production goes as fast as the least lucky and dumbest of those 10,000 things."
And a bunch of them are not even in our control.
So it’s insanely difficult.
I’m fond of saying that prototypes are easy and production is hard.
"And I do believe that the really remarkable thing that Tesla’s done, it’s not to make an electric car or to be a car startup because there’ve been hundreds of car startups in the United States and outside United States."
So the thing that’s remarkable is that Tesla didn’t go bankrupt in reaching volume production.
"That’s the amazing part because everyone else did because they all thought the prototype or the idea was the hard part, and it is not."
It is trivial by comparison with actual production.
"So it’s always worth noting that of all the American car companies, there are only two that have not gone bankrupt, and that is Ford and Tesla."
"So, the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory."
And we must be careful that we cannot do that.
"They often, if you look at the look at history, so often at the Caesar’s feet are set on the day of victory."
We will endeavor not to make that the case at Tesla.
So let’s see.
"The Model Y is in Texas and made Texas, and Berlin will look very much like the Model Y’s we currently make, but that there are substantial improvements in the difficulty of manufacturing."
"So for example, the Model Y made here and in Berlin will have a cast front body and a cast rear body."
"Whereas the one in California has cast rear body, but not a cast front body."
"We’re also aiming to do a structural pack with 4680 cells, which is a mass reduction and a cost reduction."
But we’re not counting on that as the only way to make things work.
"We have some backup plans with a non-structural pack and 2170, essentially."
"So, but at scale production, we obviously want to be using 4680’s and structural pack."
"From a physics standpoint, this is the best architecture."
"And from an economic standpoint, it is the lowest cost way to go."
"So the lightest, lowest cost, but there’s a lot of new technology there."
So it’s difficult predict with precision.
When does it work and when do you reach the scale production.
Andrew’s going to talk a bit more about the 4680 productions.
Yeah.
"So we are making great progress in 4680 cells, but there is a tremendous amount of innovation that we’re packing into that 4680 cell."
And so it’s not simply a sort of minor improvements on state of the art.
"There are… And we went through this on the factory sell date, really dozens of, half a dozen major improvements and dozens of small improvements."
"So I think it will be great, but it’s [inaudible 00:09:43] to say when the last of the technical challenges will be solved."
"So in conclusion, our team continues to make huge efforts to make our factories run at full speed, which is very difficult."
"We have had some factory shutdowns due to a power shortages, and we hope those will be relieved in the coming weeks and months."
And we’re making great progress on self driving.
"So far this is not easy to see because of, at the foundational software level."
"And so it ends up being sort of a two steps forward, one step back situation, and, but over time, if you do two steps forward, one step back and keep going, you do move forward."
"So I’m highly confident that the cars will be capable of full self-driving if they full self-driving computer and the cameras, I’m confident that they will be able to drive themselves with the safety levels substantially greater than that of the average post."
"But again, thanks to all of our employees who are making this a breakthrough year for Tesla and an incredible quarter."
"Thanks, guys."
Yeah.
I just want to reemphasize the extraordinary difficulty of ramping production of large manufactured items.
"At risk of being repetitive, it’s actually easy to make prototypes or sort of handle small volume production, but anything produced at high volume, which is really what’s relevant here, it’s going to move as fast as the slowest of the, say rough order of magnitude, 10,000 unique parts and processes."
"And so you can have 9,999, where just one is missing."
"We were missing, for example, a big struggle this quarter was the module that controls the airbags and the seatbelts."
And obviously you cannot strip a car without those.
"And that limited our production severely worldwide, in Shanghai and in Fremont."
"So it wouldn’t have mattered if we had 17 different car models, because they all need the airbag module."
It’s just irrelevant.
"So in order for Cybertruck and Semi to scale to volume that’s meaningful for customer deliveries, we’ve got to solve the chip shortage, or working with our suppliers."
"People sometimes say, why don’t you just build a chip vat?"
Okay.
"Well, okay."
"That would take us, even moving like lightening, 12 to 18 months."
So it’s not like you can just whip up a chip vat.
"It’s just like, yeah, just make a quick chip vat."
So some of these things are … yeah.
"Anyway, it is quite a trial dealing with all of the constraints of scaling a large manufactured object."
I think it may be the case that Tesla is scaling.
I think we might be the fastest in history ever for scaling a large manufactured object.
"Maybe the Model T would have been comparable back in the day of the Ford Model T. Probably internet knows the answer, but I think we may be scaling large manufactured objects at the fastest rate in history, or I’d like to know who did it faster so we can learn from them."
"So it’s worth just noting that, in the grand scheme of things, it’s not bad."
"So, yeah."
"So the Cybertruck and Semi actually both are heavy users of sub capacity, so we’ve got to make sure we have the sub capacity for those two vehicles or it’s kind of pointless."
"We can make a small number of vehicles, but the effective cost, if you make a small number of vehicles, is insane."
They would literally cost a million dollars piece or more.
"There’s a reason why you do things at volume production, which is to get the economies of scale that get the cost down."
"So we are looking at a pretty massive increase in cell availability next year, but it’s not like in January one, it comes through … it ramps up through the course of next year."
But even without Tesla … (silence).
Hello?
"Even without Tesla’s cell production, our suppliers will be able to deliver about twice as much cell output in next year as this year."
"[inaudible 00:19:51], do you want to talk more about that?"
Yeah.
It’s worth noting.
"If you have a target of a certain number, that doesn’t mean it happens as sure as night follows day."
It’s a target.
"So if there is some calamity in the world that interrupts the supply chain, then it will be less."
"But the contracts that we have with cell suppliers, roughly a doubling of cell supply to Tesla in 2022."
"And we have to joggle these exponential … it’s whole bunch of exponential graphs, sort of overlayed on top of each other."
And small changes in where you are on the X axis of time can quite substantially change the area under the code.
"So what we’re thinking of doing is, depending on if … It’s basically overshooting on cell supply for vehicles, and then, as we have, say excess cell supply in one month or another, then routing that cell’s outputs to the Megapack and Powerwall."
"[inaudible 00:21:30] if we’re prioritizing vehicle production, if there’s a shortage of cell output for some reason, then we will throttle down Megapack and Powerwall production."
But something’s got to give basically.
"Yes, exactly."
There’s a tremendous amount of inertia in the supply chain.
"So if we say to a supplier, we want you to double cell output."
"Well, even doing that in a year is very difficult."
And then that system has a tremendous amount of momentum.
It is like a flotilla of supertankers.
It’s insane.
Yeah.
"As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest parts of the entire supply chain, which goes all the way back to raw materials, lithium and nickel and that kind of thing."
"And there’s sometimes misperception that Tesla uses a lot of cobalt, but we actually don’t."
"Apple uses, I think almost 100% cobalt in their batteries and cell phones and laptops, but Tesla uses no cobalt in the iron phosphate packs and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries."
"So on a weighted average basis, we might use 2% cobalt compared to Apple’s 100% cobalt."
Anyway.
So it’s really just not a factor.
We expect to basically have zero cobalt in the future.
"I think probably there is a long-term shift, more in the direction of iron-based lithium-ion cells over nickel."
"As the energy density of sort of iron or iron phosphate, but might as well just call it iron, the phosphate is taken for granted."
"But iron-based cells, lithium-ion cells, and nickel-based lithium-ion cells, I think probably we’ll see a shift, my guess is probably to two-thirds iron, one-third nickel or something on that order."
"And this is actually good because there’s plenty of iron in the world, there’s an insane amount of iron, but nickel is … there’s much less nickel."
And there’s way less cobalt.
So it is good for relieving the long-term scaling to move to iron-based cells mostly.
"And I think long-term, possibly all … There’s a good chance that all stationary storage that is Powerwall and Megapack moves to iron."
It seems most likely the case since you do not need to transport it.
And there’s less of volume capacity constraint for stationary storage.
"So then nickel would be for, really for long range road transport, ships and aircraft and that kind of thing."
"Yes, we’re currently thinking it’s a real simple thing where you just download the Tesla app and you go to a supercharger and you just indicate which stall you’re in."
"So you plug in your power, even if it’s not Tesla, and then you just access the app and say, turn on the stall that I’m in for how much electricity."
And this should basically work with almost any manufacturer’s cars.
There will be a time constraint.
"So if the charge rate is super slow, then somebody will be charged more."
Because the biggest constraint at the superchargers is time.
How occupied is the stall?
And we’ll also be smarter with how we charge for electricity at the superchargers.
"So rush hour charging will be more expensive than off-hours charging, because there are times when the superchargers are empty and times when they’re jam packed."
And so it makes sense to have some time-based discrimination on them.
"Yeah, exactly."
"So, yeah, I think we’re … In Europe and China and most parts of the world, it’s the same connector for everyone."
"So this is a fairly easy thing to do, developed our own connector, which in my opinion is actually the best connector."
It’s small and light and looks good as a standard.
"So we developed our own connector, which in my opinion, is actually the best connector because it’s small and light and looks good."
"So an adapter is needed to work for EVs in North America, but people can buy this adapter and we anticipate having it available at the superchargers as well."
If people don’t sort of steal them or something.
Okay.
So that’s a constraint on the North American thing.
That’s basically a vestige of history.
But I think we do want to emphasize that our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy.
"It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors, which is sometimes used by some companies."
Yeah.
"Obviously in order for superchargers to be useful to other car companies, as far as we need to grow the network faster than we’re growing vehicle output, which is not easy."
We’re growing vehicle output at a hell of a rate.
So superchargers needs to grow faster than vehicle output.
"So this is a lot of work for the supercharger team, but it is only useful, in the grand scheme of things, it’s only useful to the public if we’re able to grow faster than Tesla’s vehicle output."
That is our goal.
"Yeah, really this is not … We’ll definitely make the 4680 reliable enough for vehicles."
"And we, I think, are at the point where, in limited volume, it is reliable enough for vehicles."
"Again, going back to limited production is easy or prototype production is easy, but high volume production is hard."
There are a number of challenges in transitioning from …
There are a number of challenges in transitioning from a small scale production to a large volume production.
"Not to get too much into the weeds of things, but right now we have a challenge with basically what’s called calendaring, or basically squashing the cathode with material to a particular height."
It just goes through these rollers and gets squashed like pizza dough basically.
But very hard pizza dough and it’s damaging the calendar rolls.
"This is not something that happened when the calendar rolls were smaller, but it is happening when the calendar rolls are bigger."
We weren’t expecting that.
Exactly.
"Meantime, we have a massive amount of equipment on order and arriving for the high volume self production in Austin and Berlin."
"Obviously, given what we’ve learned with the pilot plant, which is in Fremont, which is really quite a big plant by most standards, we will have to modify a bunch of that equipment."
"So it won’t be able to start immediately, but it seems like, Drew correct me if I’m wrong, but we think most likely we will hit an annualized rate of 100 gigawatt hours a year sometime next year."
"I mean, my guess is, more likely than not, above 50% of reaching a hundred gigawatt hours a year by the end of next year on annualized rate."
Something like that.
It could shift by a little bit.
"But, as Drew said, it’s nothing fundamental."
Just a lot of work.
Yeah.
"I guess, I’ll do an interview."
"I mean, [inaudible 00:34:21], if I’m doing interviews, I can’t do actual other work."
"So it’s not, there’s only so much time in the day."
"But yeah, I’ll do it once."
"I wouldn’t do it annually, but I’ll do it once."
"I think, also, this is, I would say, the last time I’ll do earnings calls."
I will no longer be default doing earnings calls.
"Obviously, I’ll do the annual shareholder meeting, but I think going forward, I will most likely not be on earnings calls unless there’s something really important that I need to say."
I think Cyber Track ramp will be difficult because it’s such a new architecture.
It’s going to be a great product.
"It might be our best product ever, but there’s a lot of fundamentally new design ideas inside of a truck."
"Nobody’s ever really made a car like this before, a vehicle like this before."
"So, there’ll probably be challenges because there’s so much unexplored territory."
Right.
"Well, like I said, I think we might be the fastest growing company in history for any launched, manufactured item."
Those who have not actually been involved with manufacturing ramp up have just no idea how painful and difficult it is.
"It’s like, you got to eat a lot of glass and for our manufacturing ramp, it’s hard."
"That took longer than that, about a year."
Yeah.
"For Shanghai, it was incredible that we obtained both those factories in 11 months, but it took longer building the factory."
"It took longer than that to actually reach volume production, high volume production."
It took about a year.
"When you put a factory in a new geography, in order for that factory to be efficient, you have to localize the supply chain."
There’s no such thing as cut and paste.
It does not exist.
"It would obviously be insane to do vehicle production in Europe, but send vast numbers of parts from North America."
"That would make producing in Europe, for example, just crazy."
"You’ve got to localize the supply chain to have efficiency, and then you’re moving as fast as your least lucky, least good supplier."
It’s supply chains where you go three or four layers deep.
"Frankly, I feel at times that we are inheriting old force majure of Earth."
"So, if anything goes wrong anywhere on Earth, something happens to mess up a supply chain."
We are exponentially growing.
"Also, it takes a while to hire old people and train old people to operate the factory."
"The factory is like giant cybernetic collective, and you can’t just hire 10,000 people and have it work instantly."
It is simply not possible.
I really encourage more people to get involved in manufacturing.
"I think, especially in the US."
This has just not been an area where all that many smart people have gone into.
I think US has an over allocation of talent in finance and law.
It’s both a criticism and a compliment.
I’m not saying we shouldn’t have people in finance and law.
I’m just saying maybe we have too many smart people in those areas.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Manufacturing is great.
It’s a very interesting problem.
Obviously you can’t have stuff unless someone makes it.
That’s how you gets stuff.
We don’t have a lot of ideas on this to be frank.
Really full self-driving is the main thing.
Things are obviously headed towards fully autonomous electric vehicle future.
"I think Tesla is well positioned, and frankly is the leader objectively, in both of those arenas, electrification and autonomy."
"It’s always tempting to try to find analogies, with other companies, whatever, but really the value of a fully electric autonomous fleet is it’s going to be gigantic, boggles the mind really."
That will be one of the most valuable things that is ever done in the history of civilization.
It’s not worth commenting on right now.
It’s not meaningful.
"We really need full self-driving, at least the beta, to be widely available so that anyone who wants it can get it."
"Otherwise, it would be pointless to read anything into where things are right now."
"At least in the US, we don’t see regulation as the fundamental limiter."
"We’ve also got to make it work, and then demonstrate that the reliability is significantly in excess of the average human driver for to be allowed, for people to be able to use it without paying attention to the road."
I think we’re going to have a massive fleet.
"It will be, I think, straight forward to make the arguments on statistical grounds, just based on the number of interventions, especially in events that would result in a crash."
"At scale, we think we’ll have millions of miles of travel to be able to show that the safety of the car with auto pilot on is a hundred percent or 200% or more safer than the average human driver."
"At that point, I think it would be unconscionable not to allow auto pilot, because the car just becomes way less safe."
It would be like-
Because the car becomes way less safe.
Shake the elevator analogy.
"Back in the day, you used to have elevator operators with a big sort of switch to operate the elevator and move between floors."
"But, they get tired or maybe drunk or something or distracted."
"And every now and again, somebody would be kind of sheared in half between floors."
That’s kind of the situation we have with cars.
"At what time we will become so safe that it will be unsafe to manually operate the car, relatively speaking?"
"And today, we were just getting in an elevator, we pressed the button for which Lori wanted, and it just takes us there safely."
It would be quite alarming if elevators operated by a person with a giant switch.
That’s how it will be with cars.
Yeah.
It’s really difficult for us to make specific predictions.
It’s very difficult.
"I think you feel confident of say at least 50% growth year over year, next year, and maybe it’s a hundred percent."
We need a lot of crystal balls to figure out exactly what it’s going to be.
And it is literally impossible to make a specific prediction.
"But you know, at least 50, maybe 100, something like that."
Yeah.
Don’t over-emphasize dry cathode.
Maybe it’s like 10 or 15% of the cost improvement or something like that.
I don’t know.
20% maybe?
Yeah.
"So people don’t think like, this is like the Messiah or something."
"You know, wet versus dry, reduces to dry as like 10% less cost than wet."
"So it’s not 10%, so nothing to sneeze at, especially if you’re making hundreds of gigawatt hours a year."
"But it’s about the Messiah, basically."
Yeah.
"Yeah, we, we are in fact working with our existing suppliers to reduce 46 80 format cells."
"And this is just a guess right now, but I see us consolidating around the 46 80 nickel-based structural pack and for long range vehicles."
"And then not necessarily a 46 80 format, but some other format for iron based cells."
"So we kind of have the Baskin Robbins of batteries situation where there’s so many formats and so many chemistries that it’s like, we’ve got 36 flavors of a battery at this point, you know?"
"This results in an engineering drag coefficient where each variance of cell chemistry and format requires a certain amount of engineering to maintain it and troubleshoot, and this inhibits our forward progress."
"So it is going to be important to consolidate to maybe ideally two form factors, maybe three."
"But ideally one nickel chemistry and one iron chemistry, so we don’t have to troubleshoot so many different variants."
Yeah.
And we do expect to see significant increases in supply from our existing suppliers in addition to the sales that Tesla’s making.
So it’s both.
"Sometimes I get questions from our sales suppliers of like, “Oh, are we just going to make all the cells in ourselves?” So then we’re like nope, please make as many as you possibly can and supply them to us."
We have a significant unmet demand in stationary storage.
Mega pack is basically sold out through the end of next year I believe.
We have a massive backlog in Powerwall demand in Powerwall versus production is an insane mismatch.
"Now, part of that problem is also the semiconductor issue."
So we use a lot of the same chips in the Powerwall as we do in the car.
"So it’s like, which one do you want to make, the cars or Powerwalls?"
So we need to make cars so that Powerwall production has been reduced.
"But as that semiconductor shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up."
Powerwall production.
I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of a million units of Powerwall next year.
"Maybe towards on the order of 20,000 a week, but again, dependent on self-supply and semiconductors."
"But in terms of demand, I think there’s probably demand for in excess of a million Powerwalls per year."
And actually just a vast amounts of omega vacs for utilities.
"As the world transition to a sustainable energy production, solar and wind are intermittent."
And by their nature really need battery packs in order to provide a steady flow of electricity.
"And when you look at all of the utilities in the world, this is a vast amount of batteries that are needed."
"That’s why long-term, we really think combined Tesla and suppliers needs to produce at least a thousand gigawatt hours a year and maybe 2000 gigawatt hours a year."
Okay.
"You’re asking like, is the FSD take rate too expensive?"
And that’s why we’re doing subscription?
Or I’m not sure if I understand your question correctly.
Yeah.
It’s like any given the price is going to be wrong.
"So we’ll just adjust it over time, as we see if the value proposition makes sense to people."
I’m not thinking about this a lot right now.
We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition.
Otherwise people are kind of… Depending on the future.
"Like right now, if it doesn’t make sense for somebody to do FSD subscription, I think it’s debatable."
"But once we have full self-driving widely deployed, then the value proposition will be clear."
"And at that point, I think basically everyone will go use it."
Or a rare individual who doesn’t.
Great.
Thank you.
So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels.
"Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed a billion dollars in non-GAAP net income for the first time, and we’ve seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and our demand is the best we’ve ever seen."
"So if you talk about we’re used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter, and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1."
So Model 3 became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
"In fact, I should say the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world."
"The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time the best-selling premium sedan, has been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3, and this is only three and a half years into production and was just two factories."
"For Model 3 to be outselling its combustion engine competitors, I think, is quite remarkable."
"In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly a quarter million Model 3s, which translates to annualized rate of half a million per year."
"When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world and probably next year."
"So I’m not 100% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely."
"I’d say more likely than not that in 2022, Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world."
"Then with regard to full self-driving, full self-driving beta continues to make great progress."
"It is definitely one of I think one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that’s maybe ever existed, and really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, specifically real-world artificial intelligence."
"And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer that was designed, but nonetheless a small computer that’s using on the order of 70 or 80 watts."
"So this is a much harder problem than if you were you, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or something like that."
"This has got to fit into a smaller screen, and I think with the elimination of radar, we’re finally getting rid of one of the last crutches."
"Radar was really … It was making up for some of the shortfalls of vision, but this is not good."
"You actually just need vision to work, and when your vision works, it works better than the best human because it’s like having eight cameras."
"It’s like having eyes in the back of your head, beside your head and has three eyes of different focal distances looking forward."
This is … And processing it at a speed that is superhuman.
"There’s no question in my mind that with a pure vision solution, we can make a car that is dramatically safer than the average person."
"But it is a hard problem, because we are actually solving something quite fundamental about artificial intelligence, where we basically have to solve real-world vision AI, and we are."
And key to solving this is also having some massive data set.
"So just having well over a million cars on the road that are collecting data from very sort of corner case rare situations, sort of like so many weird things in the world like a truck carrying a truck or a car with … One example is a car, as an actual example, a car with the kayak on the roof where the kayak has a little weight dangling from the front of the kayak in front of the car, but yet the car must ignore this and just look at the road."
"So it’s really quite tricky, but I am highly confident that we will get this done, so yes."
"This quarter, and I think we’ll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3."
"So Q1 had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we’ve ever experienced in the life of Tesla, and same difficulties with supply chain over the whole range of parts."
"Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage."
"This is a huge problem, but then in addition to that, for example, we had quite a difficulty scaling, driving our production in China because we’re unable to get critical engineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions, which meant that Tesla worldwide was dependent on drive units made at our factory in Nevada, Giga Nevada, so that was a very challenging situation."
I think we’re mostly out of that particular problem.
"That was just two of many challenges, so the team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chain shortages."
"So with respect to the Model S and X, there were more challenges than expected in developing the Model S or what we call the Palladium program, which is the new version of Model S and X, which has a revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics and has, for example, a PlayStation 5 level infotainment system."
"There’s just a lot of issues encountered ensuring that the new factory was [inaudible 00:08:49], So it took quite a bit of of development to ensure that the battery of the new S/X is safe."
"And we’re trying to get all the [inaudible 00:09:08] in the cars slowly for the past few months, but we’re just stacking them up in the yard and just making refinements to the cars that we built."
"But we do expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month, and then to be in sort of fairly high volume production for the X in Q3 and start delivering Model X in Q3 as well."
"So I think as we ramp up, I think probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high, so it’s really just going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes."
"So probably we’re going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week."
"Perhaps if we get lucky, upwards of 2,400 or 2,500."
"This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which there’s just a lot of factors outside of our control here."
"But I do think this will get solved, so it’s just a matter of time and then we’ll be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week."
It’s a great car.
"It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce, but it is a superior product."
"So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in 2021 and ’22."
We’re building factories as quickly as we can.
"Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well, and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year."
"At this time, we are continuing to ramp production of Model Y in Fremont and Shanghai."
"In the background, we’re continuing development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, the Roadster and other products."
Thanks to everyone at Tesla who made this year a huge success.
"Now, on to questions."
"Sorry, Zach."
My apologies.
I was on mute.
"So, yeah, I was just basically saying that although like right now people think of Tesla’s … A lot will think of Tesla as a car company or perhaps an energy company."
"I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company."
I think we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world.
"Certainly, we appear to be able to use things with full self-driving that others cannot."
"So if you look at the evolution of what technologies we developed, we developed them in order to solve the problem of self-driving, so we couldn’t find a powerful enough neural net that runs a computer, so we designed and built our own."
"The software out there was really quite primitive for this task, and so we built the team from scratch and have been developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in the world."
"And then it sort makes sense that this is kind of what needs to happen because the road system is designed for a neural net computer, our brain."
"Our brain is neural net computer, and the entire road system is designed for vision with a neural net computer, which is because it’s designed for eyes and the brain."
"And so if you have a system which has very good eyes, you can see in all directions at once, you can see three focal points ahead or forward, but it never gets tired."
It’s never texting.
"It has redundancy and its reaction time is super human, then it seems pretty obvious that such a system would achieve an extremely high level of safety, far in excess of the average person, so that’s what we’re doing."
Then Dojo is kind of the training part of that.
"So because we have over a million cars, and perhaps next year we’ll have two million cars in active use, providing vast amounts of video training data that then needs to be digested by a very powerful training system."
"And currently, we use Tesla training software."
"So we developed a lot of training software, a lot of labeling software to do, to able to do surround video labeling, which is quite tricky."
This means all eight cameras simultaneously at 36 range a second per camera labeling video over time.
"There wasn’t any tool that existed for this, so we developed our own labeling tool."
"Then taking it a step further, obviously, the Holy Grail is auto labeling."
"So now we’re getting quite good at auto labeling, where the trainers train the training system and then the system auto labels the data and then the human laborers just need to look at the labeling to confirm that it is correct and perhaps make edits."
"And then every time an edit is made, that further trains the system."
"So it’s kind of like a flywheel that’s just sort of spinning up, and really, the only way to do this is with vast amounts of video data."
"So then we need to train this efficiently, so Dojo is really a supercomputer optimized for neural net training."
"We think Dojo will be, probably in order of magnitude, more efficient on, say … I’m not sure what the exact right metric is, but say per frame of video, we think it will be an order of magnitude more cost efficient in hardware and in energy usage per frame of video compared to a GPU-based solution or compared to the next best solution that we’re aware of."
"So then possibly, that could be used by others."
"It does seem as though over time … I mean just an observation, I think basically is the fact that neural net based computing or AI-based computing is and more and more of the compute stack.Conventional computing, perhaps heuristics-based computing is still going to be important, still going to be very important, but but neural net will become a bigger and bigger portion of compute."
"So anyway that was a long story but I think, yeah, probably others will want to use it too and we will make it available."
Yeah.
"First of all, I should say that the demand for the solar roof remains strong, so despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the solar roofs."
"So production is going fine, but we are chocked at the inflation point."
"We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessing the difficulty of certain roofs, but the complexity of roofs varies dramatically."
"Some roofs are to be literally two or three times easier than other roofs, so you just can’t have a one-size-fits-all situation."
"If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is it not strong enough to hold the solar roof, then the cost can be double, sometimes three times of what our initial quotes were."
"So in those cases, what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit, but what we cannot do is go and just lose a massive amount of money."
We’ve just got to provide a refund of the early deposit.
"But what is I think the most important about the solar roof situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we’re shifting the whole sort of solar situation, the solar power … Well, basically, solar power situation to there’s only one product basically … There’s only one configuration."
We will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall.
"That solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solarglass Roof, but in all cases, it will have the power to … Technically, it’s actually Powerwall 2 plus, if you will."
The plus refers to a higher peak power capability.
"So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak power capability than the specification on the website."
They have about twice the power capability roughly.
"It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about arguably twice the steady-state power of the specification of the website."
"The energy is the same, but the power is roughly double."
So all installations will have a Powerwall and the difficulty installation will dramatically … Or the difficulty of the installation will be much less.
"It will be much easier because the power from the solar roof, Solarglass Roof or the solar panels, will only ever go directly into the Powerwall, and the Powerwall will only ever go between the utility and the main power panel of the house, which means you never need to touch the main circuit breakers of the house."
You never need to touch the house circuit breakers.
"Effectively, almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a unique work of art and requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel."
So this is extremely important for scalability is.
"It’s the only way to do it, really, and this also means that every solar Powerwall installation that the house, or whatever the case may be, will be its own utility."
"And so even if all lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power, so that gives people energy security."
"And we can also, in working with the utilities, use the Powerwalls to stabilize the overall grid."
"So let’s say that there’s, like there was in Texas, there was a peak power demand, and the power demand, because the grid lacked the ability to buffer the power, they had to shut down power."
"There’s no power storage, no good point on power storage."
"However, with a whole bunch of Powerwalls and houses, we can actually buffer the power."
"And so if the grid needs more power, we can actually then, with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and in partnership with the utility, we can then actually release power onto the grid to take care of peak power demand."
"So effectively, the Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility."
This is profound.
"I’m not sure how many of you will actually understand this but this is extremely profound and necessary because we are headed toward a world where, as we were just talking about earlier, where people are moving toward electric vehicles."
This will mean that the power needs at homes and businesses will increase significantly.
There will need to be a bunch more electricity coming somewhere.
"In fact, if you go to full renewable electricity, we need about three times as much electricity as we currently have."
"So these are rough numbers, but you roughly need twice much electricity if all transport goes electric, and they need three times much electricity if all heating goes electric."
"So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think, both for Tesla and for the utilities."
"And in fact, I think if this is not done, the utilities will fail to serve their customers."
They won’t be able to do it.
"They won’t be able to react fast enough, and we’re going to see more and more of what we see, say, in California and Texas of people seeing brownouts and blackouts and the utilities not being able to respond because there’s a massive change going on with the transition to electric transport."
And we’re seeing more extreme weather events.
This is a recipe for disaster.
"So it is very important to have solar and batteries at the local level, at the house."
"In addition, it is important to have large battery storage at the utility level, so that solar and wind, which are the main forms of renewable electricity, that electricity can be stored because sometimes the wind doesn’t blow."
Sometimes it blows wide.
"Sometimes it blows too much and sometimes it didn’t blow enough, but if you have a battery, you can store the energy and provide the energy to the grid as needed."
"The same goes for solar because, obviously, the sun does not shine at night and sometimes it is very cloudy, and so by having battery storage paired with solar and wind, this is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future."
"And as I said, it needs to occur both at the local level and at the utility level."
"If it doesn’t occur at the local level, what will actually be required is a massive increase in power lines in power plants, so they have to put long distance and local power lines all over the place."
They’ll have to increase the size of the substations.
It’s a nightmare.
"Substations, it’s a nightmare."
This must occur.
There must be solar plus battery.
That’s the only way.
So yeah.
"I think especially with just going through the facts of the… What I mean specifically, there was an article regarding a tragedy where there was high-speed accident in a Tesla, and there was really just extremely deceptive media practices, where it just blamed the autopilot which is completely false."
And those journalists should be ashamed for themselves.
Please go ahead.
Larson.
As mythical as non-buyers.
Yeah.
"I mean, we’ve got a long way to go before we’re dealing with seasonal technology issues, but certainly a way to deal with seasonal technology would be to have wind and solar barring on the side of what’s more subtly latitudes, but then across a variety of longitude."
"So essentially, like let’s say in the U S for example, if there was a, I’m not sure if people understand this, that you can actually power the entire United States with just sort of a hundred, roughly a hundred mile by a hundred mile grid of solar."
"Sometimes people don’t quite understand like, well, how much solar is needed to power the United States."
Almost nothing of this [inaudible 00:40:22] statements is true of almost any country in the world.
The solar incidence is a gigawatt per square kilometer.
This is insane.
"In fact, if you took the clear area, just the area for nuclear power plants, the area that is considered not usable because a nuclear power plant is there."
"In most cases, if you just put solar there it would generate more power than in the nuclear power plant who, because they typically have pretty wide clear areas."
"If you have say 25% efficient solar panels, and then those are 80% efficient in how they’re laid out, you’re going to do about 200 megawatts per square kilometer."
"Therefore, you know, five square kilometers is a gigawatt, which might be a typical sort of power plant."
It’s really not much area at all.
"And a lot of places can have wind and solar, same place."
"So anyway, it’s entirely possible to power all of us with a small percentage of Earth’s area."
And then to transmit that power through high voltage DC lines.
No new technology.
"You don’t need like, room temperature superconductors… Also, other myth, room temperature superconductors are almost irrelevant in my opinion, almost irrelevant."
"Low cost, long distance, power lines using copper or aluminum, are just very important."
So heating is I squared R. So that’s current squared times resistance.
"So as you increase voltage, you can drop the current dramatically and drop the heating dramatically to the point where it is of minor relevance."
"Like maybe, you lose five to seven percent with a high voltage DC power line, something like that."
"So I want to clear, no new physics is necessary, no new materials necessary."
We just need to scale this thing up.
The technologies exist today to solve renewable energy.
"And some people say, well, why don’t we do it?"
"That’s because the energy base of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanely gigantic."
So you can’t just go and do a zillion terawatts overnight.
"You’ve got to build the production capacity for the cells, for the battery cells, for solar cells."
You’ve got to put that into vehicles.
You’ve got to put that into stationary storage packs.
"You’ve got to put out your solar panels and solar cost roofs, and you’ve got to deploy all this stuff."
But it is certainly the case that we can accelerate this and we should try to accelerate it.
"And the right thing to do I think from an economic standpoint, and I think an economist would agree, is to have a carbon tax just as we have a tax on cigarettes and alcohol, which we think are more likely to be bad than good."
And we would tend to tax fruit and vegetables less.
The same should be true.
"We should, we should tax energy that we think is probably bad and support energy you think is probably good, just like cigarettes and alcohol versus the fruits and vegetables."
It’s just common sense.
"On the plus side, I’m not suggesting anyone to be complacent, but sustainable energy, renewable energy will be solved."
It is being solved.
But it matters how fast we solve it.
"And if we solve it faster, that’s better for the world."
There’s no question in my mind whatsoever that the energy storage problem can be solved with lithium ion batteries.
Zero.
I want to be clear.
Zero.
"I think the bias will tend to be towards iron based lithium ion cells who, people might think, look, there must be a big constituent of the cells."
It’s more like one to two percent of the cell is lithium.
The main part of the cell is the cathode.
The main mass and cost in the cell is the cathode.
"For high energy cells, for example what we use in most, most houses have have nickel based lithium-ion cells, which have higher energy density, longer range than iron based cells."
"However, stationary storage, the energy density is not as important because it’s just sitting on the ground."
"And so I think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron based lithium ion cells with an iron phosphate cathode, technically."
But I think the phosphate part is unnecessary.
It’s really just the iron or nickel.
I’m misreading the terminology.
"Just think of it as iron and nickel, and there is an insane amount of iron in the world."
More iron than we could possibly use.
There’s also more lithium than we could possibly use.
"Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron phosphate lithium ion cells."
"Oh, I think we’re so we’re so quite far away from it."
"I mean, the thing to bear in mind with production is, for those who have never done production, they just don’t understand how insanely hard production is."
"I want to really be very, very emphatic here."
Prototypes are trivial.
They’re child’s play.
Production is hard.
It is very hard.
"Now you say production at large-scale with higher liability and low cost, insanely difficult."
What Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car.
"The truly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the first American car company to achieve volume production of a car in a hundred years, and not go bankrupt."
"So this is, basically, myself and many others at Tesla had to basically have several aneurysms to get this done."
"It was so hard, no idea."
"So anyway, and the thing about making a large, complex manufactured object is let’s say you have-"
"The thing about making a large complex, main central object is let’s say you have trusts or approximation 10,000 unique items."
If even one of those items is slow.
"That situate just one doesn’t matter, so trivial we’ve had production stuff because of carpet and the trunk."
"We have production stuff because a USB cable, at one point for wireless, we literally raided every electronics store in the bay area for, a few days there, nobody could buy a USB cable on the barrier because we, went and bought them all to put them in the car, literally."
And there’s like hundreds of stories like that.
"So anyway, that’s the solving those constraints and, a logistics problem that makes world war II look trivial."
I’m not kidding.
"Like the scale is insane, we told him no, he ends up cars, some massive global supply chain, 50 countries, dozens of regulatory regimes."
It’s the same.
"So, yeah."
Not at this time.
"[inaudible 00:50:56] but we have the small sort of pallet plants, which is still big by normal standards, expect to have like a 10 gigawatt app for your capability and pretty much California."
And were they quite a few cells?
"We’re not, quite yet at the point where we think cells are reliable enough to be shipped in cars, but we’re getting close to that point."
"And, and then we’ve already, ordered most of the equipment for battery production in Berlin and Austin as well."
"So we’re, really down to like the nitty gritty elements, but overall, I think we’re still quite optimistic about achieving volume production of the 4680 next year."
[crosstalk 00:52:11].
"Yeah, basically this is just a guess, because we don’t know for sure, but it appears as though we are about 12 probably not more than 18 months away from volume production at the rate of 46 80."
"Now at the same time, we are actually trying to have our outsell supply of partners ramp up their supply as much as possible."
So this is not something that is to the exclusion of suppliers.
It is in conjunction with suppliers.
So we’re super clear about that.
This is not about replacing suppliers.
It is about supplementing suppliers.
"So we have a very strong partnership with CATL with Panasonic and LG, our request to our strategic partners for sale supply is please supply with as much as you possibly can, provided the prices affordable."
We will buy everything that they can make.
"Yeah exactly, we do expect from suppliers to receive double sell output next year versus this year."
"We’re ending poker problem margins in storage as in, vehicle, but it is important."
Bear in mind that vehicle is more mature than the storage.
"So we already are at good margins with the Power wall, but some additional work is needed, put a mega pack to achieve good margins pretty quick."
"We have, a clear runway for improving the customer, the megawatt hour, the mega pack."
"So I got, go ahead again."
Yeah.
I think all of the above.
"Yeah, we won’t talk too much about spiritual product development, conference calls are not, the right place to make major part announcements, but yeah, we’ll get there, but we’ll provide later."
Thanks sir.
Thank you.
So just to recap the year.
2020 was a defining year for us on many levels.
"Despite a challenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5 million cars."
"I’d just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort."
"We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history, so really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging 2020, so my hat is off to such hard work with such great people at Tesla."
"And full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3 billion on building new factories and other expenditures."
We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
"Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity."
We started producing the model out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.
"We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly."
We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
We started and we’re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings for Model Y.
"This is where, for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made."
We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
"We’re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year."
"And lastly, we built a battery cell factory in the Bay Area."
"And even though it is a pilot plant, its capacity is large enough that it would be probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant."
"Regarding the new Model S and X, we’re super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X pad are in production now and will be delivered in February."
"So we’ve been able to bring forward the pad Model S and X, and Model S will be delivered in February and Model X a little later."
"The Model S pad, and we’re actually in production now, and we’ll be delivering next month."
So this is a tri motor Model S with a completely new interior.
There are actually a lot of great things about this.
"I’ll do another call about the Model S later, but it’s really a tremendous improvement over the prior version."
And the Model S pad will be the first production car ever that is able to go 0 to 60 miles an hour in under two seconds.
So no production car ever has been able to get below two seconds zero to 60.
"This is a luxury stand that is able to go 0 to 60 in less than two seconds and will have the ability to seat up to seven people with the third row seats, so this is pretty nice."
This is faster to be clear than any car.
"It’s not like there was a different type of car, like a two-door sports car that was able to do that."
This is the fastest accelerating car ever made that is allowed to go on roads in history.
"And like I say, we’ll start delivering it in a matter of weeks."
"We’ll obviously get into the details what the Model S changes maybe later this week or next, but it’s really better in many ways."
We will be actually raising the price of Model S for these new models.
"If you have the old model, the new model will be $10,000 more, so hopefully people aren’t too upset if they bought the old model last month, but this one’s $10,000 more."
"So yeah, we think it’s probably the best car of any kind at any price available in the world today."
"So then with regard to full self-driving, we’ve made massive progress on Full Self-Driving."
I recommend watching the videos of our public beta.
"So we’ve got, I think, almost 1,000 people in the beta at this point."
"And with each successful release of the beta FSD software, it’s really improving rapidly."
It’s not very common for … I drive the latest build.
"It’s very common for me to have no interventions on drives that I do, including drives to a place that I’ve never been to."
So these are not preplanned routes.
"The car has never been there before, and it’s now actually more common than not for the car to have no interventions, even on a complex drive."
"Basically, I’m highly confident the car will drive itself for the reliability in excess of a human this year."
"This is a very big deal, and thinking about like how does one justify the value of the company being where it is?"
"And I think there is a way, just with back of the on road map to potentially justify it, where if Tesla ships, let’s say, hypothetically, $50 billion or $60 billion worth of vehicles, and those vehicles become full self-driving and can be used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an average of 12 hours a week to potentially an average of 60 hours a week, if they’re capable of serving as robotaxi."
So that’s like roughly a five times increase in utility.
"But even if you say like, “Okay, let’s just assume that the car becomes twice as useful,” not five times as useful, but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of the company, which is almost entirely gross margin."
"So it would mean, it would be like if you made $50 billion worth of cars, it will be like having $50 million of incremental profit basically from that because it’s just software."
"If that’s the case, then you get 20 PE on that, it’s like $1 trillion and the company is still in high-growth mode."
"So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of the company where it is using just the cars and nothing else, the cars with FSD, and I suspect at least some number of investors are taking that approach."
"So in conclusion, while 2020 was a turning point for Tesla and in terms of profitability, we believe this is just the beginning."
"We think 2021 is going to be even more exciting, and you don’t know what to expect in a given year."
"Obviously, last year, we did not hear many things, we do not expect."
But assume that ’21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint.
I think it’s going to be a great year for Tesla.
We’ve got many great new products coming out.
We’ve got factories that are advanced factories out of [inaudible 00:09:54] production.
"It will also make it easier how you’re having a factory in Berlin, one, in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint."
"Texas can help supply the eastern half of the U.S., and Berlin can help supply Europe."
"And there’s just pure cars on both, much less capital tied up with big cars that have been transported to customers."
I think the fundamental efficiency of the company will be much better with the factories or at least having factories on each continent and having two factories in the U.S.
"So I’m super excited about the future, and yes, we look forward to making it happen."
Thank you.
Yeah.
"So we’re actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter over quarter last year, and we had our best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4."
So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it.
"Unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building."
"We had to take the whole company, including a bunch of people that were on solar and had to work on cars, but now we’ve got a little more bandwidth, we’re putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly."
So I think it will not be long before Tesla is by far the market leader in solar.
Yeah.
"And actually, an important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar and Tesla Roof."
"And we’re confident we’ll have excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar whether it’s retrofit, or the [inaudible 00:16:30] Roof before the end of the year."
So I think we’ve got a good strategy.
"As Zach mentioned, we’re focused on reducing the amount of time and the complexity of the install, and we’re making great progress in that regard."
And I think we’ll have something that’s really dialed in this year.
"Unfortunately, we’re not considering that at this time."
We do actually offer a higher price for a car with the FSD than the one without FSD.
"And I do think that the market currently undervalues… The consumer market, and arguably the stock market, does probably undervalue just how good FSD is going to be."
But we’re not currently planning allowing it to get transferred.
We will be offering subscription pretty soon in the next month or two.
So that should address a lot of people’s concerns for being able to get it.
Andrew?
I guess I’m competence based on my understanding of the technical roadmap and the progress that we’re making between each beta iteration.
Yeah.
"As I was saying, it’s not remarkable at all for the car to completely drive you from one location to another through a series of complex intersections."
"It’s now about just improving the corner case reliability and getting it to 99.9999% reliable, with respect to an accident."
"Basically, we need to get it to better than human by a factor of at least 100% or 200%."
And this is happening rapidly because we’ve got so much training data with all the cars in the field.
And the software is improving dramatically.
We also write the software for [inaudible 00:20:47].
"And I’ll say, it is quite challenging."
We’re moving everything towards video labeling
So all video labeling for video inference.
And so there’s still a few of the neural nets that need to be upgraded to video training and video inference.
"And really, as we transition to each net to video, the performance has become exceptional."
So this is a hard thing.
"The labeling software that we work for, video labeling, making that better has a huge effect on the efficiency of labeling."
"And then, of course, the Holy Grail is auto labeling."
"So we’re putting a lot of work into having the labeling tool be more efficient when used by a person, as well as enabling auto labeling, where we can."
Dojo is a training supercomputer.
We think it may be the best neural net training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude.
So it is a whole thing in and of itself.
And this is something we could offer potentially as a service.
So some of the others need neural net training.
We’re not trying to keep it to ourselves.
So I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself.
"And then, of course, for training vast amounts of video data, and getting the reliability from 100% to 200% better than an average human to 2,000% better than average human."
So that will be very helpful in that regard.
I think we kind of talked about that through.
"Essentially, what we’re saying is that the number to think about or focus on is we’ve got a 100 gigawatt-hour total that Tesla cells produced in 2022."
"It’s not that important to look at the run-up to that, because these things tend to improve exponentially."
"But we are installing capacity, in 2022, for 200 gigawatt hours a year, and we think probably we should be able to achieve 30% of targeted design capacity in 2022."
Yeah.
And we don’t see any showstoppers.
Yeah.
"So it really goes back to what I was saying a moment ago, which is, we need to transition over the neural nets in the car to a video."
"And in order to do that, the whole stack has to be changed to video."
"That means gathering video clips, then using… And this is actually surround video."
So you’ve got eight cameras operating simultaneously with synchronized frame rates.
So you’ve got basically eight camera around video.
"And then you’ve got to label basically everything in that video snippet, and then train against that, and then have those neural nets operate the car."
"And this is coming from the past where we would label… The neural nets would be a single camera, single frame."
"So no video, and not combining the cameras."
"And then we went from a single frame, one frame at a time, one camera at a time neural nets, to surround camera… Neural nets would look at all eight cameras, but only one frame at a time, and now to where we include the time dimension, and that’s video."
"So I really just see this as a question of getting the work done, we’re getting it done, and you can see the results in the rapidly improving FSD betas that are released."
And we’re also going to be expanding the FSD beta itself to include more and more people.
"So from my standpoint, it looks like a very clear and obvious path towards a vehicle that will drive 100% safer than a person."
Yeah.
I really don’t see any obstacles here.
I think we are very open to licensing our software to third parties.
And we’ve had some preliminary discussions about licensing autopilots to other OEMs.
So this is something we’re more than happy to do.
"But I think, obviously, we need to probably do a little bit more work to prove that Tesla autopilot is capable of full self-driving, which, like I said, I think will become obvious later this year."
And then we’re more than happy to license that to other car companies.
We’re definitely not trying to keep it to be a Tesla exclusive situation.
And I think the probably same goes to Autobidder.
We haven’t thought as much about Autobidder.
But the Tesla philosophy is definitely not to create walled gardens.
We’re going to allow other companies to our supercharger networks.
"And yeah, using our autonomy software and Autobidder, and perhaps other things, would be fine too."
"Well, we are currently the leader in the Chinese EV market."
So I think we must be doing something right if we’re the best selling electric car in China.
"That said, very few of our customers in China."
"I admit, maybe as low as one or 2%, actually have selected the FSD option."
This is much lower than rest of the world.
So we definitely need to make it work well in China.
"I think, some of it works well in China, then we will have a [inaudible 00:31:53] for FSD."
"I find the customers in China, Tesla owners in China, are among the most discerning in the world."
… in China are among the most discerning in the world.
The attention to detail is incredible.
I’m confident that they will buy [inaudible 00:32:14] worked in long term.
"And hopefully, that is later this year."
"Yeah, it is."
"So, the fundamental limits on electric vehicles right now, in general, is availability of cells."
"What’s the output of battery cells in jiggawat hours, and you can’t grow faster than that."
"Now, at Tesla we’ve improved the efficiency of our product dramatically, such that you can actually get pretty good range, even with the standard range e-pack."
"It’s projected for model three, it’s approaching the high two hundreds."
"And, with some slight continued improvements, we’ll get to the 300 mile range to a standard pack, and [inaudible 00:33:34] 500 kilometers."
"So, the efficiency improvements in the car."
But fundamentally the growth is dependent on cell production.
"And there’s actually a lot of other companies that want to, that have a need for cells."
"So, the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth."
It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
"In fact, I want to be really clear Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers."
"And we’ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL, or Panasonic, or LG, that we will take as many batteries as they can produce."
"And we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us."
"Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable."
"But I’m trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers, it is to supplement our suppliers."
"And we want to have suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition, have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production."
"So, it’s acceleration over and above what the most that our suppliers would say they can produce for us."
"And so, probably since the cell output drives vehicle output, then probably the broad brushstroke value of Tesla is just, what’s the set off of [inaudible 00:35:32] that vehicle output."
"And then, at least double that for autonomy revenue."
"Probably won’t’ level, and that’s how you figure out the value of the company in the long term."
Right.
"So, we’re finished with the cyber truck engineering."
"So, we’re no longer iterating at the design center level or the line level."
"We’ve got design specs, we’re getting to order the equipment necessary to make the cyber truck work."
"We’re actually going to be using even bigger testing machines for the rear body of cyber truck, because you’ve got a bigger vehicle and you’ve got a long truck bed that’s going to split a lot of load."
"So, we’ll be using an 8,000 tons casting press for the rear body casting as opposed to 6,000 tons for a Model Y."
"So, 6,000 tons was the biggest cast Tesla mold, 8,000 tons is quite a bit bigger than that."
And I think it’s an incredible vehicle.
"If we get lucky, we’ll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year."
But I expect volume production to be in 2022.
Okay.
"Zach, do you want to [inaudible 00:37:56]?"
"No, it does not."
"Although we are talking with them about making the 40/60/80 point factor, it is not required."
"For example, the new S Car B uses the 18650 form factor."
"So, that’s just a more advanced cell."
"And we think we’ll continue to use that form factor for at least a few years, but we will over time be retiring the form factors and trying to move to a consistent form factor."
"But it is not a requirement that we place on our suppliers, because it just results in fewer cells."
"So, it’s better for us to deal with the complexity of different cell form factors than insist on a single form factor for our suppliers today."
"Like I said, over time, it will make sense to have a consistent form factor."
That is one of the things that limits to growth rates.
"It doesn’t limit the ultimate size, but limits the growth rate, which is the rate at which we can onboard great people and get them trained in the right areas."
"You usually can’t, like instantaneously, if you’ve got a factory that has 20,000 employees, you can’t just hire 20,000 people instantly."
They’ll usually bring something else.
"So, they’ve got to transition from whatever they were doing or move from some other part of the country."
"And so, there’s a certain amount of time required for that."
"That said, we do think that we can maintain a growth rate in excess of 50% per year, for many years to come."
At least we’re producing here for many years to come.
"I think this year we may attract to a fair bit about 50%, but we don’t want to commit to that."
"But at least that’s what it would appear, and the same again next year, it appears to be hopefully about 50%."
I think Tesla is definitely going to make an electric van at some point.
Some things to bear in mind is that there is fundamentally a constraint on battery cell output.
"So, if you’re not involved in manufacturing, it’s really hard to appreciate just how hard is this to scale production."
It’s just the hardest thing in the world.
"Prototypes are easy, scaling production is very hard."
"So, a big part of the reason, the main reason we have not accelerated new products is, like for example, the Tesla semi, is that we simply don’t have enough cells for it."
If we were to make-
… our cells group.
"If we were to make the semi like right now, which we could easily go into production with the semi, but we would not have enough to cells built for it right now."
We will have enough cells for Semi when we are producing the 4680 volume.
"But for example, Semi would use typically five times the number of cells that a car would use, but it would not sell for five times what a car would sell for."
"So it kind of doesn’t make … It would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint."
The same would go for that.
"Yeah, to be clear, the software still does not fully use the capabilities of the FSD version one computer."
"It is really just an incredibly powerful computer, and I am personally certain that you can create full self-driving with safe Level 5 [inaudible 00:49:23] just using the full self-driving Version 1 computer."
"The Version 2, we expect to be about three times as powerful, and this needs to be paired with higher resolution cameras."
And so it requires a bunch of things to change simultaneously.
But we have not been rushing the Version 2 of the chip.
"It’s coming along well, and it’s in good shape, but since we can achieve FSD, full self-driving, with the current system, it would actually be a distraction right now if we were to introduce the Tesla FSD chip 2 because it would set us back quite a bit on software, and software is the critical path to full self-driving."
So I wouldn’t worry too much about that.
That’s an improvement but not a game changer.
That has to be changed.
"Getting the software to work and getting all the neural nets to the video, that’s the game changer."
"I think we feel very confident about achieving those targets, let’s say, over a three-year time frame."
I don’t know.
It’s not like year one.
"So three, maybe four years, give ourselves a little room."
"But for three or four years, I’d say."
Yeah.
"We’re aspiring to do better than Battery Day, but we are confident of at least for doing what we presented at Battery Day."
Sure.
"Well, I expect to be CEO of Tesla for several years, so I think there’s still a lot that I’m super excited about doing, and I think it would be hard to leave a lot of these great projects halfway or part like hallway done."
So I do expect to be running the company for several years into the future.
"Now obviously, nobody is or should be CEO forever, so I don’t expect to be."
"The sheer amount of work required to be CEO of Tesla is insane, and I think I definitely do more technical work than is typical for a CEO."
"So it would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands as opposed to just working day and night, from when I wake up to when I go to sleep seven days a week."
"It’s pretty intense, but I think the mission isn’t over yet, and we still got a long way ago before we can really make a dent in the world on accelerating the advent of sustainable energy."
"I mean, the goal Tesla, from beginning, has been to accelerate sustainable energy, but if you say like what percentage of cars on the road are electric today, it’s still very, very tiny, like an order of 1%, or less than 1% of the total fleet worldwide."
So that’s the full have long way to go for on the order of 1% of the fleet is electric.
"There’s also a tremendous way to go on solar power, although it’s exciting to see the advent of very cost-competitive wind and solar and geothermal."
"Of course, we need a large volume of stationary battery packs."
"I mean basically, maybe the three legs of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, led by solar, wind, geothermal and hydro and a few others."
I’m actually not against nuclear fission.
"I actually think nuclear fission is, with a well-designed reactor in a situation that is not subject to bad weather or seriously bad weather is actually is a good thing to do."
Then the second thing you need is stationary storage need batteries because most renewable energy is intermittent.
The wind doesn’t blow all the time.
"The sun doesn’t shine all the time, so you need a lot of batteries, and it needs to be very long-lasting and high cycle life, and then you need electric transport."
"If you have those three things, we’ve got a very bright future with respect to energy and the environment."
"So a long way to go on that, and so I’m still very much fired up to work on that."
"I think that’s quite likely, yes."
"Yes, I can’t imagine … I’m not sure who would be number two, but yes, it seems highly likely, yes."
Yeah.
That’s true.
Yeah.
"As it is, we need to modify the parameters."
"Software parameters change for autopilot or self-driving because it needs now to Model 3, Model Y, Model X or Model S. We just need to inform the vehicle, inform the full self-driving brain that it is now in a Semi Truck."
No.
"I think there will be … You have a different control functions because there are turns that you could do in a regular car that you cannot do in a Semi, like you do want to try to parallel park this thing on the street in a city."
It needs to know its limitations being a giant truck.
Yeah.
"I mean, honestly, I’ve had this question a million times for just for regular vehicles, even back in the early Roadster days, even before we had the Roadster out."
"People were saying that somehow hydrogen is going to be a better means of energy storage in a car than batteries, and it was like this is just really not the case."
Hydrogen is a very … It’s number one in the periodic table.
It’s got very low density.
"It’s got low density as a liquid, like styrofoam-level density as a liquid."
"And then it’s only a liquid very close to absolute zero, so you have to have a … It’s really not realistic to keep it as liquid."
"You want to have it as a high-pressure gas that has even lower density, so you need a gigantic fuel tank volumetrically, and it’s got to be very high pressure."
"It’s a big pain in the ass, basically."
"If somebody is going to, say, use an ultimate chemical energy storage mechanism to hydrogen, I’d say just use propane or something like that or methane."
Those will be way better than hydrogen.
And then having it be a fuel cell just adds even further complications to the situation.
It’s just crazy basically.
And we’re extremely confident that we could a long-range trucking with batteries.
The math works out.
"If you could just take, say, watt-hours per kilogram of currently available cells, and say, “Okay, what weight would you need to go, let’s say, 500 miles, and to what degree does that affect your payload?” It’s like, “Okay, if you do it right, you basically have no effect on your payload or almost nothing, and you can have a long-range truck.” I mean, Jerome, do you want to add to that?"
"But basically, we do not see any issues with creating a compelling long-range truck with batteries."
Apart from cell supply.
Cell supply is the only thing.
Cell supply’s it.
Thanks.
Bye.
"Thanks, Martin."
"All right, so Q3 was our best quarter in history."
"We achieved the record production deliveries, record revenue, record net income; both GAAP and non-GAAP and record free cash flow of $1.4 billion."
This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team.
I could not be more proud to work with such a great group of people.
Just really kick-ass performance throughout the world.
"Of course, we had our Battery Day."
"So we hosted, showed our plans for how we can expand in the future and improve core battery technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistry level and I think more significantly at the manufacturing technology level."
There’s a comment I made in the past is that I think Tesla’s long-term competitive strength will be primarily manufacturing.
"This is counterintuitive, but I’m quite confident this will be what happens."
All right.
So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries.
We wanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch.
"First, wishful thinking, just look at it from the fundamental physics and say rather than compare to other products in the market, just say from a physics standpoint, what’s the limit of physics?"
What’s the platonic idea of the perfect cell and how close can we get there?
And that was our aspiration.
"I think we’ve got a pretty good approach to it, which will have to get better over time."
"And we went through all of the engineering solutions for every important part of battery design and production, and we’ll continue to iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology."
"The result, we think, in a few years will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capital expenditures required are a-third or less of what they are today, and we expect Giga Berlin will see our first battery cell production line at scale."
"Regarding the full self-driving beta release, the Autopilot team, again, just a really all-star team."
I spent a lot of time with the Autopilot team.
"And there’s a lot of really talented people in that team who’ve worked incredibly hard to get the beta release out, so I’d just really like to thank them for their hard work."
And it’s just a very smart group of people.
"So I think we’re starting very slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place, and so we put it out there last night, and then we’ll see how it goes and then probably release it to more people this weekend or early next week, and then just gradually step it up until we have, hopefully, a wide release by the end of this year."
"And of course, as the system collects more data and it becomes more robust."
So it’s sort of like how does Google as a search engine get better?
"It’s because everyone is programming it by asking questions all the time and clicking on particular links, so it’s got this great feedback and that makes it an extremely effective search engine."
"It’s the same thing for autonomy, having on the order of a million cars that are providing feedback and specifically feedback on strange corner case situations that you just can’t even come up with in simulation."
This is the thing that is really valuable.
"It’s not like the obvious stuff you can do in simulation, but weird corner cases."
Only reality can give you that.
"But we’re able to say, “Okay, we need to train the system on this corner case situation and look for examples, so we can then try it against those examples and improve some very esoteric corner case.”"
And it’s also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach.
"There is no need for high-definition maps or a cellphone connection, so the system is designed such that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you’re in a place that you have never been to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like a person."
That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year.
Then in terms of capacity build out.
We’re making progress on the three major factories.
"We’re continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well at Tesla China team."
"It is just, I mean, incredibly good."
"Super smart, work hard."
It’s like I’m always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes.
It’s beyond all reasonable expectations.
"And then we’re under construction in Berlin and Texas and Austin, so we’re also making good progress there."
Yeah.
Good.
It’s overall going well.
"I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin, we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year, but because of the exponential nature of the spool up of a manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it will start off very slow at first and then afterward will become very large."
"Just in general, manufacturing follows the S-curve, and I think sometimes people, if they haven’t spent a lot of time manufacturing, kind of think that once you have a factory, you can just sort of turn it on and it’s at capacity."
"But it will typically take about 12 to 18 months to reach capacity, and that is a very fast period of time, especially for new technology."
"So yes, I’d say, 12 to 24 months even."
"So generally, what I see is the manufacturing capacity is underestimated in the beginning for quite some time, then it is sometimes overestimated because this is an s-curve."
"It goes exponential to linear to logarithmic, and it’s actually an incredibly hard thing, just bringing a production plant up to volume technology."
"If you can actually think of it like you’ve got to first order approximation, 10,000 unique parts of processes, all of which operate on an s- curve and with a bunch of uncertainty, and you can just slide 10,000 s-curves on an x-axis, and that’s what’s bringing up a large automotive plant is like."
Which one is the laggard?
Which one is the leader?
"It’s very difficult to tell, and it’s constantly changing, so it’s really one of the most difficult challenges I’ve ever seen."
So let’s see.
"In conclusion, thank you."
What we would achieve would not be possible without the incredible hard work of the tens of thousands of Tesla employees and all people and our suppliers as well.
I’d like to thank our suppliers.
"We continue to grow as fast as we can while focusing on cost control and improving quality, and ultimately the best company will be that which makes great products at an affordable price, and that’s our goal."
I think I’ve never felt more optimistic about the future of Tesla than I do today.
I’d also like to thank investors who have stuck with us through thick and thin.
I think there’s a lot more good stuff to come.
All right.
"With that, we can move to questions."
Okay.
Sure.
Yeah.
"Drew, do you want to take that?"
Yeah.
"I mean, here’s the way to think about a product, in my opinion."
"You have to say, I think, what do you want the world to look like?"
"When you look around the neighborhood in future a decade from now, what do you want?"
What products are going to make your life better?
What future do you want?
"And I think a future where we’ve got beautiful roofs with generating energy that are tough and resilient and better in every way than a regular roof and a lab with energy, that’s the future we want."
The Solar Roof is a killer product.
This will become obvious next year.
"Well, as I think about this today."
Tesla has probably … There’s probably in excess of a dozen startups effectively in Tesla.
Every major product line is a start-up.
"Every big new plant is a start-up and sometimes, frankly, we have to learn a lesson a few times before it sinks in."
Even things like service and sales are startups.
"Other car companies, OEMs, they don’t own their sales and service, so we have to create our service network."
We have to create our sales and delivery network.
"We have to do this in, I don’t know, 40 countries, multiple languages."
So many people don’t really even know much about is our internal applications team that writes the core technology that runs the company.
We are not dependent on enterprise software.
"For those who understand what this means, this is a very big deal."
And my hat’s off to the great work of the internal applications team.
"They are like the nervous system, the operating system of the Company, the Tesla operating system, extremely fundamental."
"Obviously, insurance is substantial."
"So insurance could very well be 30%, 40% of the value of the car business, frankly."
"And as we’ve talked about before, with a much better feedback group, instead of being statistical, it can be specific."
"And obviously, somebody does not have to choose our insurance, but I think a lot of people will."
It’s going to cost less and be better.
So why wouldn’t you?
And the whole autonomy thing is a start-up.
Designing our computer chips was a start-up.
"Obviously, cells are a start up."
"Designing and making our own power electronics for the drive unit, design, manufacturing our own motors, chargers, the Supercharger network is a start-up."
"I think that people just don’t really understand about Tesla is that it’s a whole chain of startups and like, “Well, you didn’t do that before.” Yeah, but we’re doing it now."
"I mean, I think so far, we’ve maybe been a bit slow with some of the start-ups, but I don’t think we’ve had any of them fail."
"So, so far so good."
No plans to spin anything out.
That just sounds like added complexity.
We think we’re focused on enabling the robotaxi system.
So you can just basically … That’s really quite a small subset of the overall robotaxi or robocar thing where you can have the car get autonomous for you.
You can have the car be you have to share with friends and family.
You can add or remove it from the network.
You can have it be entirely in the network.
"I mean, if you’re an Uber or Lyft driver, you could be managing a fleet of 10 cars."
This sort of seems like a shepherd tending the flock type of thing.
It’s like you just get way more leverage.
So I think we could do that.
"It wouldn’t be very difficult, but we’re going to just be focused on just having an autonomous network."
"That has sort of elements of Uber, Lyft and Airbnb."
Yeah.
"Yeah, go ahead, Drew."
"Yeah, absolutely."
"I think for heat pump in the car, being able to use the batteries, both as a thermal and an electric energy reservoir is very significant."
"Same thing could be applied to a home with the water heater and the battery pack itself, of course."
"So I think there’s potential for an integrated home system that kind of does power generation storage, heating, cooling, air filtration, water purification in a really tight package."
"We don’t actually have a prototype or anything, but I think conceptually, that is something that would be probably good to have."
"Well, we want to make our cars more affordable, and it’s really important to separate out affordability from value for money."
"If the car is too expensive or any given product is too expensive and people don’t have enough money in the bank account, they simply can’t buy it no matter what the value proposition is."
So it is important to lower the prices in order to such that people can literally just have enough money to buy it.
"I do not think we lack for a desire for our product, but we do lack for affordability, and so we have to improve the affordability of our products, so they are not out of reach of people."
"We want to bring them more in reach over time, but also improve our cost of production."
"Obviously, we get, hopefully, a little bit better every year."
"Sometimes a lot better, and in terms of margins, all of these margins are going to look pretty comically small when you factor in autonomy."
Yes.
We’re ramping up stationary storage a lot.
"So I mean, it’s approximately doubling."
"We expect it to approximately double next year, so that’s pretty good, and hopefully we can accelerate that in years to come."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"I mean, if you just keep doubling things, pretty soon, you hit the mass of the universe, and we’ll need to start turning Jupiter into cells."
Yeah.
So I think we’re trying to de-risk to 2021 so that there’s almost no dependency on our internal cell production.
"It’s very, very small."
… production.
"It’s very, very small."
"The internal cell production will help us ramp in ’22, but we’re not dependent on it for ’21."
"Yeah, and our pilot line is pretty big as pilot lines go."
"It will be in the top 10 cell factories on Earth, I believe."
Subscale one.
"Yeah, so …"
Yeah.
"I mean I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through the next financial is that if things are doubling every year or even just growing 50%, then if you shift plus/minus one year, it has a huge effect on the number.It sounds like, wow, you either massively exceeded or massively undershot, but it’s actually, what’s going on is a giant S-curve."
"So a whole bunch of pretty big S-curves that integrate into a gigantic S-curve, so that’s why it’s difficult to predict the middle."
"And I’m not saying for sure we’ll hit 20 million vehicles, but it does seem like a good goal to have because that would mean that we’re replacing 1% of the global fleet per year."
And it’s difficult to say that we’re … Are we really changing the world if we’re not switching out 1% of the global fossil fuel vehicles?
"I mean, I’m not sure that we can make that argument unless we change at least 1% of the vehicles per year."
So that’s where the 20 million vehicle per year comes from.
"It’s like 1% of two billion vehicles, which is the global fleet currently."
"The global fleet is growing, so probably will be a bit bigger in the future."
So it’s hard to say.
It’s like map an S-curve to a 20 million vehicle target in 2030 and move a slider around and see what that number looks like.
That will give you about as much insight as we have.
Yeah.
"I mean answering the first part, the cell production system is fairly agnostic on anode, cathode, electrolyte, separator, that kind of thing."
"We could change, and we will change and upgrade all aspects of the cell."
"And we could, for example, make ion phosphate or nickel manganese or something like that."
It’s quite adaptable.
So I wouldn’t say just too much more about it.
"The lithium, like a pure lithium anode it’s not as great as it may sound."
"Yeah, volumetrically, you’re not gaining all that much because if you got nothing, let’s say on the anode side, and you just play out lithium, it’s got to go somewhere, so you’ve got to have room for it."
"Yeah, exactly."
"But if it should turn out that a pure lithium anode is the right move, that would be no problem."
Sorry.
"Are you talking about for cell manufacturing or something, or-"
Okay.
"Well, I mean, Tesla is absurdly vertically integrated compared to other auto companies or basically most any company."
We have a massive amount of internal manufacturing technology that we build ourselves.
We literally make the machine.
"In fact, we design, so like, okay, what are the things we want to make, design a machine that will make that thing, then we make the machine."
"This makes it quite difficult to copy Tesla, which we’re not actually all that opposed to people copying us, but it’s quite difficult because you can’t do catalog engineering."
"You can’t just, “I’ll pick up the supplier catalog."
"I’ll get one of this machines, one of that machine."
"Bingo, I’m now Tesla.” There is no catalog."
What catalog?
So we made the machine that made the machine that made the machine.
"Now, we don’t want to get carried away here, and quite frankly, we would like to outsource less."
"That would be great, because then if we could outsource … If we take something that we’re doing and outsource it, then we could take those people, and we’re going to have them do something else."
"But yeah, it’s like we’re just making a crazy amount of machinery internally."
Tesla is not well understood.
"If you just walk around the factory, you’d just get a sense for it."
"And, yeah, I don’t know if this is like a smart move, But I just know, hey, if we’re trying to make progress and nobody’s got the machines that we need, we’ve got to make it, so we do."
Yes.
"I mean, something like insurance is a good example of a product that’s basically made by our internal applications team."
"So we made the insurance product and connect it to the car, look at the data, calculate the risk."
This is all basically internal software application.
It’s pretty low capital but has very high return.
I don’t know.
We’re trying to spend money at the fastest rate that we can possibly spend it and not waste it.
"That’s our current plan, and so it’s quite hard to spend money without wasting it."
"We’re really just trying to not waste too much of it, frankly."
"We will certainly waste some of it, but trying to not to waste too much of it."
This is very difficult.
"But otherwise, we just try to spend money as quickly as possible in a way that is sensible and yields more value than it costs."
"I mean, totally free, probably not."
"I think even if it was free, we wouldn’t put it on."
"Well, I don’t know how much he cares about this, but I guess, he sure is investing a lot of money in it."
"I mean, I think you obviously, if you care about autonomy, you need to focus on vision because the entire road system is based on passive optical, so you have to solve passive optical to have a self-driving system that is a generalized solution."
"And once you solve passive optical, you’ve solved self-driving, so why bother with anything else?"
Welcome.
Sure.
I was in the studio actually last Friday with Franz and the team just going over just sort of some improvements to the Cybertruck.
"Generally, at Tesla, we really aim to make the car that is delivered better than the car that is unveiled, because it always drove me crazy."
"Car companies would unveil these awesome looking cars, and you’re like, “Great."
"Can’t wait until they make that,” and then the car they actual make is much worse, and it’s really disappointing?"
"So, man, we always want to make the car that we deliver be better than the car we unveil, and that’s the goal with the Cybertruck."
So there’s a lot of small improvements compared to what was unveiled.
"I think it’s going to be better than what we showed and yeah, it’s cool."
"It’s going to be made in Austin, so dependent on completing that factory, and there are obviously new technologies with the high hardness kind of armored exoskeleton."
"It’s never been done before, so there’ll probably be some challenges along the way."
"And obviously, something that’s extremely high hardness and difficult to scratch or dent is also difficult to form, so there’s manufacturing challenges there."
"That’s why it’s so cleaner, although it also looks good, I think, from a cleaner standpoint."
"Yeah, if all goes well, we’ll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries toward the end of next year."
"Yeah, so it’s difficult to predict."
I’d say there’s probably a lot of deliveries in ’22 and some deliveries toward the end of next year if things go well.
Yes.
"Go ahead, Zach."
"I mean, it’s in that vicinity."
Yeah.. You’re not far off.
"Oh, well actually Jerome, do you want to answer that?"
"Sorry, go ahead."
"Yeah, just a note on the sort of Semi."
The Semi does consume a lot of cells.
So it’s a ‘four to six times’ more than a passenger vehicle.
[inaudible 00:00:51:34].
Five-ish times.
"So if we are cell constrained, it’s simple to ramp up the Semi because there’s no cells."
So we need to solve the cell constraint before ramping Semi to a significant volume.
That’s the only real constraint on Semi progress.
"And we found over and over again, we just kept running into cell production limitations, and then we’re just taking things out of one pocket and putting them in another."
"So we just need more cells so that we can do more stationary storage, more vehicles, more vehicle lines [inaudible 00:04:17], we need more cells."
I think it’s a very material for sure.
"Really long term, all transported will go autonomous."
Yeah.
"Horses are already autonomous, but all transport will go autonomous."
"Yeah, so including Semi."
So it’ll be pretty significant.
Yeah.
Just bigger and more motors.
"Well, I do think there will be other car companies."
I don’t think we’re going to be the only one.
"So I mean, the thing is that, what other car companies do even in the auto segment is quite a small subset of what Tesla does."
"So Tesla, we design and build [inaudible 00:06: 31]."
So we’re designing and building so much more of the car than other OEMs.
We will largely go to the traditional supply base and that core catalog engineering.
So it’s not very adventurous and it basically ends up like all the products end up looking the same because they’re going to the same suppliers.
"So to agree that you inherit legacy components, you inherit the legacy limitations and car structure and so you kind of need to make new ingredients, new parts, and then you need… Then there’s no machine to make those parts, so you have to make the machine that makes the parts."
"Tesla is like, we probably… I mean, we might be in order of magnitude, more vertically integrated than other car companies and which we’re not now, we certainly will be."
"And then we also have to create our sales and service and distribution system and I don’t know, something on the report 40 countries."
"Somewhere, it will be over a hundred countries."
Whereas the other car companies do not own their sales in service and distribution.
"So, they have a case that they kind of assemble parts from a supply base and then hand them to a dealer base."
"So it’s like comparing Tesla to other car companies, like just comparing just really one facet or dimension of Tesla."
We’re like maybe 10% in common with other car companies?
"Yeah, I think you are probably right about that."
"I mean RJ and Zack, what do you guys think?"
"It will be obviously longterm, yes."
"I mean, several years from now, it’s not like existing cars stop having value."
"It’s just that if you have a structural pack where the pack is contributing a structural value to the car, because of the stuff like the composite honeycomb effect of get our share of transfer between an upper and lower plate, then anything that doesn’t do that it’s going to have to duplicate hardware."
"It’s going to weigh more, it’s going to cost more."
And then the same goes for the front and rear castings.
We’re trying to make the car like you would make a toy.
If you had a toy model car then it’s got to be real cheap and look great.
How would you make that?
You would cast it.
And that’s how it’s done.
You would be absurd to make it up of tiny little pieces of stamp metal joined in complex ways.
So it’s sort of a natural thing to do.
"And then the same goes for using the energy storage, the battery, as a structure, which is done for aircraft wings and for rockets."
"The early rockets and aircraft, they had a separate aeroshell from propellant tanks or fuel tanks, and then they realized that doesn’t make sense and you’ve got to have your fuel tank in wing shape, or you got to have your propellant tanks in the shape of the body of the rocket for example."
"You don’t want to put a box on a box, basically."
Which over many years made it basically uncompetitive to have an aircraft that has separate fuel tanks from the wing.
The wings need to be fuel tanks.
But I wouldn’t think of this as like an overnight transition.
It’s several years.
"But then, like I said, overtime, it just won’t be competitive to have a different architecture, in my opinion."
Everyone.
"Well, I mean, this is definitely a new approach."
"We’ve got the Tesla drive in movie theater, basically."
It’s good to see everyone.
"It’s a little hard to read the room with everyone being in cars, but it’s the only way we can do it."
So hopefully it’s cool.
And hopefully you can hear me.
Can you guys hear me?
Okay.
All right.
Great.
"Well, thanks for coming."
"I think it’s been an incredible year and I’d like to just thank you for your support through tough times, good times."
It’s been great.
Really appreciate everyone who’s put their heart and money into Tesla and I think it’s worked out pretty well.
This has been a good year.
And I think there’s many good years to come.
So I’ll go through the shareholder presentation fairly quickly because the real main event here is Battery Day.
"And really, I’m just going through a recap of what’s happened over the past a year or so."
I think starting from in terms of our ability to create a …
"In terms of our ability to create a factory, huge kudos to the Tesla Shanghai team for being able to go from literally a dirt pile to volume production in 15 months."
"It’s like, damn."
Yeah.
And I think something that’s really quite noteworthy here is Tesla’s the only foreign manufacturer to have a hundred percent owned factory in China.
"So this is often not well understood or not appreciated, but to have the only hundred percent owned foreign factory in China is a really big deal, and it’s paying huge dividends here."
"So we really wouldn’t have the results that we have had this year without the great efforts of the Tesla China team, so I’m super appreciative of that, and we’ll see the Shanghai factory continue to scale quite a bit from where it is right now."
"I think we really could expect that to be, over time, a factory that produces over a million vehicles a year."
"Yeah, it’s cool."
So let’s see.
"So we also reached in the past year of volume production of the Model Y, and this was the smoothest launch that we’ve ever had, so I think we’re definitely getting better at a new vehicle launches and building factories and scaling production."
"As you’ve heard me say before, the hardest thing is scaling production, especially of a new technology."
It’s insanely difficult.
"Making a prototype is relatively easy, and if I think, like, what is the real achievement of Tesla in sort of car company terms, it’s like it wasn’t making sort of exciting prototypes."
"It was that Tesla was really the first company in about a century in the U.S., the first U.S. company in the U.S. to reach volume production and be sustainably profitable."
The crazy thing is this has really not happened in a hundred years.
"That’s the actual super hard part, and we now have four vehicles in volume production, S3XY."
"Also, the toughest joke I think maybe ever."
It was a very difficult joke to make.
"So we also introduced the lowest cost solar in the U.S. It’s only a dollar 49 a watt, and we really just simplified the whole value chain, so reduced sales and advertising, got rid of a bunch of unnecessary costs, and really are just relying upon the fact that it’s just the lowest cost, most efficient solar in the U.S., providing both a retrofit and the solar glass roof, which I think is a really great product."
"A hard product to make work, but it will be a major pipeline in the future."
"And we also got four consecutive quarters of gap profitability, which was very difficult."
Yeah.
And certainly a testament to the hard work of people at Tesla.
"I mean, to do this in extremely difficult times against a wide range of adverse circumstances was insanely hard, but we got it done, and I think the future is looking I think, very promising from a sort of an annual profitability standpoint."
"So in order to sort of do well financially, you really need economies of scale, and you need ideally the best technology, and I think we’ve had the best technology for a while, but now we are also achieving economies of scale, and we’re also rapidly improving autonomy, which is a massive value add to each car."
"So, I think the value of Tesla is going to be like total, just on the vehicle side, total vehicles produced times the value of autonomy."
That’s a way to think about the future value of Tesla.
We also have consistent free cashflow generation.
"This is really important for growth, and a key element here is tightening up the time from when a car is ordered to when it is built and delivered."
"So for a company that is growing rapidly, it’s extremely important to tighten the supply chain and to have, from when parts arrive, put it into a car very quickly and deliver the car very quickly to the customer."
"And if you can do that inside soft of your payables timeline, then the faster you grow, the more cash you have."
"Or conversely, if you’re unable to do it within your payables timeline, the faster you grow, the less money you will have, which is obviously bad for capital intensive situation."
"So just tightening up and having the parts move very quickly to the factory, put it in a car, get it to a customer makes a massive difference to cashflow generation."
"I mean, that’s why it’s extremely important to have a factory in each continent, because if you don’t at least have a factory in the continent, it isn’t impossible to achieve this."
"So having a factory in China, that’s able to serve China, and then soon many other countries in the region will be key to us tightening that total sort of chain of cashflow, and essentially the faster we grow, the more cash."
This is really important.
"That’s also why it’s important to have Giga Berlin complete, because then we’ll have a factory in China, a factory in the U.S. and soon a second factory in the U.S. in Austin, and a factory in Europe."
"I mean, even if for Giga Texas in Austin, even if we had exactly the same cost as in California, it would still be advantageous to do it there because it’s roughly two-thirds of the way across the U.S., so in terms of delivering cars to the central U.S. and to the East Coast, it’s just faster, it costs less, and it fundamentally improves our economics."
"So I think this is also maybe something that’s not fully appreciated of just how important it is to have a factory at least on the continent or reasonably close to where the end customers is, so you can tighten that whole chain."
Industry performance.
"While the rest of industry is, has gone down, Tesla has gone up, I think this speaks to … Thanks."
And so I’d like to thank all the customers for taking a chance on Tesla and buying our product and really hope you’re enjoying it.
"This is really, our sales, as [inaudible 01:15:21] was saying, it really grew by word of mouth, so this is really, I think it’s very pure in the sense that it’s growing on the basis of existing owners recommending it to others to new customers."
"This is, really, I think, a good way to grow."
"So, and then in 2019 we had 50% growth, and I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020."
"Probably somewhere between 30-40% growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances."
"I mean, there’s so many."
"Pandemic, the wildfires."
"It’s a whole bunch of difficult production issues, but thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team and a lot of innovative approaches to overcoming issues, we’re able to still see significant growth in one of the most difficult."
"In fact, I’d say probably the most difficult year of Tesla’s existence."
We also published our extended impact report.
"At Tesla, we try very hard to do the right thing."
"If what I think does not happen, it’s just because we maybe made a mistake or weren’t aware of it, but we always try to do the right thing to the best of our ability, and then we published the extended impact report to show just a self-examination of, okay, what are we doing, right?"
What are we doing wrong?
What can we do better in the future?
"We’re definitely trying to accomplish the most good, and so if we occasionally make a mistake, we work quickly to fix it and do the right thing."
"So it’s worth looking at the average life cycle of emissions in the U.S. and just how much better a Tesla is or electric car than any kind of gasoline car, and what we’ll talk about in the Battery Day is also just how much the grids around the world, and actually especially in the U.S., are greening."
"It’s actually much faster than I think people realize, the U.S. is moving towards sustainable energy."
"And so as we move more and more to sustainable energy, then effectively you end up building the solar factories and the car factories themselves with solar or with sustainable energy."
"Over time, you will even mine with sustainable energy, and eventually it will get to an effective emissions of zero, so that’s where things will end up."
Yeah.
So we also have safety at the core of our design.
The Tesla cars are the safest cars ever designed.
"We have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the U.S. government, And that’s just passive safety."
"When you add active safety into that, it’s even better, so it’s really … If safety is important to you, which obviously it is, the safest car you could drive is a Tesla."
"So I think some people aren’t aware of this, but it’s really safety is paramount."
It is actually the number one design objective when we build a Tesla is safety.
"Our factories are also becoming safer, and if you look at the sort of accidents per vehicle, total vehicle made it’s dramatically better than in the past, and it’s already better than industry average, and we’re confident we can get it to the best in the auto industry."
"Autopilot functionality continues to improve, and you can see it in the safety report that we publish every quarter."
It’s just getting better and better.
"The U.S. average for collisions is at roughly 2.1 per million miles, and with autopilot engaged, it’s 0.3."
"I mean, this is a profound difference, really massive, and this will get even better."
"So we’re confident that over time we can get the probability of an accident, especially the probability of injury, to 10 times better than the industry average, like an order of magnitude better."
"So that’s just a lot of lives saved and a lot of injuries avoided, so that’s a huge priority for us."
"Yeah, the autopilot front, I think it’s hard for people to judge the progress of autopilot."
"I’m driving … As a matter of course, I’ve always done this."
"I drive the bleeding edge alpha build of autopilot, and so I sort of have insight into what is going on."
"Previously about a couple of years ago, we were kind of stuck in a local maximum, so we’re improving, but the improvements kind of started tailing off and just not getting where they needed to be."
"I call this sort of getting trapped in a local maximum, and so we had to do a fundamental rewrite of the entire autopilot software stack and all of the labeling software as well."
"So we are now labeling in 3D video, so this is hugely different from the previously where we were labeling essentially a bunch of single images from the eight cameras, and they would be labeled at different times by different people, and some of the labels, you literally can’t tell what it is you’re labeling."
"So it basically made it sort of in some cases impossible to label, and the labels had a lot of errors."
"Now with our new labeling tools, we label it in video, so we actually label entire video segments in the system, so you get basically a surround video thing to label with the surround video and with time."
"So it’s now taking all cameras simultaneously and looking at how the image has changed over time and labeling that, and then the sophistication of the neural nets in the car and the overall logic in the car has improved dramatically."
"I think we’ll hopefully release a private beta of autopilot, of the full self-driving version of autopilot in, I think, a month or so, and then people will really understand just the magnitude of the change."
It’s profound.
"So, yeah."
"Anyway, so you’ll see it."
"It’s just like a hell of a step change, but because we had to rewrite everything, labeling software, just the entire code base, it took us quite a while."
The sort of new … I call it like 4D in the sense that it’s three dimensions plus time.
"It’s just taken us a while to rewrite everything, and so you’ll see what it’s like."
It’s amazing.
Yeah.
It’s just clearly going to work.
"At Tesla, the core competencies, we’ve got engineering, obviously, but also manufacturing."
"I think manufacturing is underappreciated in general, and the difficulty of designing the machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself."
"So the designing, like making a Model 3 or Model Y or Cybertruck truck prototype is really quite trivial compared to designing the factory that makes it, especially if it’s new technology, and you want to use new manufacturing methods."
"It’s just at least 10 to 100 times harder to do the factory than the prototype, and that’s why you see a lot of companies out there or startups they’ll bring out a prototype, but they just can’t get it over the hump for who manufacturing, because manufacturing of new technology especially is the hardest thing by fa."
"Basically, the prototype is at best 10% of the difficulty and probably closer to 1%."
And then software.
"Tesla is both a hardware and a software company, so a huge percentage of our engineers are actually software engineers, and you can think of our car as kind of like a laptop on wheels, so software is incredibly important."
"Actually, not just in the car, but also in the factory."
So the factory software is extremely important.
Just software in general.
"I mean, these are fundamental."
These are the three critical areas that are needed to make for an awesome company.
"So, yeah."
"So we have … Now we’ll soon have three new factories incremental on … Well, we have one already."
On three different continents.
"Shanghai, we’re expanding the Shanghai with the second phase."
"Berlin is making rapid progress, and Texas is making even faster progress."
"So, yeah."
"With each factory, what we’re trying to do is also improve the manufacturing technology, so in some cases like the Model Y made in Berlin might look the same, but it actually is made in a much more efficient way."
"Yeah, we’ll talk about that later in the battery presentation."
"Yeah, we launched Megapack."
"It’s three megawatt hours all in one energy storage solution, so it’s been great overall."
Yeah.
All right.
"And I think that’s basically it, right?"
"All right, thank you."
All right.
"Well, thanks, everyone, for coming, and we’ll be back in a little bit to go through the battery stuff, and there’s a little bit more."
"In addition to the battery stuff, we’ve got a few extras as well."
So I think you’ll really like what we have to say on batteries.
The battery stuff we’re going to talk about is truly revolutionary and essential to Tesla’s goal.
"The fundamental good of Tesla, it’s like, if you look back in history and say, “What good did Tesla do?” The good will by how many years did we accelerate sustainable energy?"
That’s the true metric of success.
"It matters if sustainable energy happens faster or slower, and so that’s really how I think about Tesla and how we should assess our progress."
By how many years did we accelerate sustainable energy?
And what we’re going to talk about with batteries and a few other things will really explain how we’re going to make a step change improvement in the acceleration of sustainable energy.
Thank you.
[inaudible 00:18:44].
[inaudible 01:40:28].
Great.
Should you start?
Great.
So let’s see.
You’ve got the clicker?
Okay.
Let’s … Yeah.
"I’ll take it at first, perhaps."
"So obviously the issues we’re facing are very serious with climate change, and we’re experiencing these issues on a day-to-day basis."
It’s incredibly important that we accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.
Time really matters.
This presentation is about accelerating the time to sustainable energy.
So the past five years were the hottest on record.
We have what looks like a wall for CO2 PPM.
It’s obviously … This time is not like the past.
It’s really important that we take action.
"Running this climate experiment is insane, so …"
Talk a bit louder.
Okay.
"So anyway, there is a lot of good …"
There is a lot of good news though.
A lot of people may not be aware that that wind and solar comprise 75% of new electricity capacity in the US this year.
So this is really major.
So the grid is going sustainable very quickly.
"Now, it’s also worth noting that the length of time that power plants lasts is on the order of 25 years."
"So even if a hundred percent of energy generation was sustainable, it will still take 25 years to convert the grid."
"And it’s also worth noting that in the past 10 years, power production from coal has dropped in half."
So it went from 46% of electricity in 2010 to 23% in 2020.
So this is a massive improvement.
So good things are happening on a lot of levels.
We just need to go faster.
"So Tesla’s contribution, we’ve delivered over a million electric vehicles, 26 billion electric miles driven, and many gigawatt hours of stationary batteries, 17 terawatt hours of solar generated."
"So I think solar is sometimes underweighted at Tesla, but it is a massive part of our future."
"The three parts of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, storage, and electric vehicles."
So we intend to play a significant role in all three.
"So to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, we must produce more EVs that need to be affordable and a lot more energy storage, while building factories faster and with far less investment."
So goal number one is a terawatt hour scale battery production.
So tera is the new giga.
And a terawatt is a thousand times more than a gigawatt.
"So we used to talk in terms of gigawatts, in the future, we’ll be talking in terms of terawatt hours."
So this is what’s needed in order to transition the world to sustainability.
"Yeah, you basically need on the order of roughly 10 terawatt hours a year of battery production to transition the global fleet of vehicles to electric."
Yeah.
"So it’s a lot of batteries, basically."
And so-
Yeah.
And this number I think might grow even more.
"As the world economy matures, and as countries with high populations industrialize, we could see this number be even more."
But let’s say it’s like roughly 20 to 25 terawatt hours per year sustained for 15 to 25 years to transition the world to renewable.
This is a lot.
So today’s batteries cannot scale fast enough.
They’re just too small.
"For Giga Nevada, 150 gigawatt hours per year is what we probably expect to make out of there."
But this is really pretty small in the grand scheme of things.
That’s only 0.15 terawatt hours.
And it costs too much.
"Yeah, and I think we should view this as more than just a question of money."
"Money is sort of an ethereal thing, but it’s really the amount of effort."
"You have a certain amount of effort in terms of people and machines, and depending on how efficient that effort is, for a given amount of effort, you want the most amount of batteries."
"So it’s not just the question of well, if we have $2 trillion, tomorrow you could make this."
It’s not that easy.
"You actually need to organize a massive number of people, build a lot of machines, build the machines that make the machines."
And so it’s incredibly important to have that effort yield the most number of batteries.
"So, and then goal two, obviously we need to make more affordable cars."
"I think one of the things that troubles me the most is that we don’t yet have a truly affordable car, and that is something that we will make in the future."
"But in order to do that, we’ve got to get the cost of batteries down."
"We’ve got to make, and we’ve got to be better at manufacturing."
And we need to do something about this curve.
The curve of the cost per kilowatt hour of batteries is not improving fast enough.
"So we’ve given this a lot of thought over many years to say, okay, how can we radically improve the cost per kilowatt hour curve?"
It’s been somewhat flattening out actually in recent years.
"Yeah, exactly."
So yeah.
"And EV market share is growing, but EVs still aren’t accessible to all."
"And you can see, as you Drew were saying, it’s like starting to flatten out a little bit because the rate of improvement of the affordability of cars is just not fast enough."
So that’s why we’ve got Battery Day.
Yeah.
"It’s weird, the slides don’t show up quite right here."
What shows up on the screen is not quite what shows up there.
It’s different.
"That one’s current, supposed to be current."
Whatever.
Yeah.
"I mean, we basically thought through every element of the battery, or almost every element."
"There are a few more elements that we won’t get to today, but we will get to in the future."
"Actually, slight note on why is the one called 18650, although not on the slide, versus the 2170, is that the first two digits refer to the diameter, and the second two digits refer to the length."
So that helps explain what’s up with these weird numbers.
But nobody could explain to me why there was an extra zero.
"So I, so I said, “Okay, well, we’re deleting the zero that nobody can explain in future form factors.” So that’s why it’s technically, it’s like the 18650 bizarrely, but going forward it’s the 2170, because we just got rid of the extra zero because it’s pointless."
"Any fool, any fool could make a bigger form factor."
Are we not any fool?
Yeah.
"That’s what these t-shirts mean, but it’s very esoteric."
"It was like, nobody could figure it out."
Yeah.
This is important to appreciate.
"Basically the distance that that electron has to travel, it’s just much less."
So you actually have a shorter path length in a large tabless cell than you have in the smaller cell with tabs.
This is a big deal.
"So even though the cell is bigger, it actually has more power."
The power to weight ratio is actually better than the smaller cell with tabs.
"This is, again, this is quite hard to do it."
Nobody’s done it before and it really took a tremendous amount of effort within Tesla engineering to figure out how do we make a frigging tabless cell and have it actually work and then connect that to the top cap.
"There’s a whole bunch of things that we’re keeping a little secret sauce here that we’re not telling everything, but-"
Yeah.
"I mean, everything is simple in recollection, after you… it’s hard until it’s discovered and then it’s simple."
"So anyway, there’s a lot of really cool things going on that enable tabless."
And it was really due to a really great engineering team.
Drew and the rest of the team had done amazing work in achieving this tabless construction.
"I think it may sort of sound a bit silly to some people, but for people that really know cells, this is a massive breakthrough."
Yeah.
"Just to elaborate on that a bit, it’s like when the cell is going through the system, it has to keep stopping where all the tabs are."
So you can’t do a continuous motion production if you have tabs.
You have to keep stopping and then there’s a rate at which you can start and stop and accelerate again and it really slows down the rate of production.
And then sometimes you get the tabs wrong and you also lose a little bit of active area.
It’s really a huge pain in the ass to have tabs from a production standpoint.
Yeah.
So these… Yeah.
It’s pretty great.
"And just to clarify, when we see these plus 16% or whatever the percentage rate increase is, these are the amounts due just to that particular innovation."
"So we’ll list a whole bunch of innovations and then when you add them up, you get a total improvement in energy density and cost."
But these numbers are what refer to just this thing.
Yeah.
So.
Yeah.
It’s a video of some of what’s going on in the plant.
Now.
"I mean, to be clear, it will take about a year to reach the 10 gigawatt hour capacity."
So this is important to appreciate.
"When you build a factory, there’s a certain capacity that you design to, and then it takes some period of time to actually achieve that capacity."
So I would say it’s probably about a year before we get to the 10 gigawatt hour annualized rate with the pilot plant.
And this is just a pilot plant.
"The actual production plants will be more on the order of maybe 200 gigawatt hours, maybe more over time."
"I mean, it’s hard actually, just to be clear."
"If this was easy, everyone would do it."
It’s not like dry coating electrode is actually easy.
It’s actually very hard to do what appears to be a simple thing.
"And it’s worth noting, we did acquire Maxwell a little over a year ago, I guess, and certainly a good company and everything, but the dry coating they had was like, it’s like sort of, I would call proof of concept."
Since the acquisition.
We’ve actually ramped the machine that does dry coating four times.
"So revision full post acquisition of the machine, and there’s still a lot of work to do."
So I would not say this is completely in the bag.
It’s still a lot of work to do.
"And as you grow, as you scale, go from benchtop to lab to pilot to volume production, there are actually major issues that you encounter at every level."
"It’s not like you make something work on your bench and bingo, now you can make a bazillion of it."
It’s insanely difficult to scale up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I mean, to be clear, I would like to not say that right now, it just totally working."
"It’s close to working, but it’s not, even now at the pilot plant level, it is close to working."
"It’s fair to say probably it does work, but with not a good, not a high yield."
"There’s a clear path to success, but a ton of work between here and there."
But this is a really profound improvement.
"Again, for people that know battery manufacturing, this is gigantic."
We’ll probably be on machine revision six or seven by the time we do large scale production.
The rate at which the machines are being improved is extremely rapid.
"Literally every three or four months, there’s a new rev."
"Exactly, no stop lights and traffic lights sort of thing."
You want the highway.
Yeah.
So you can sort of think about the sort of the fundamental physics of a factory or something.
I think it’s actually quite a lot like the rocket equation where you’ve got basically the rocket equation you’ve got your exhaust velocity and then the log of [end 02:05:24] masses.
So it’s basically saying how fast are things going and what percentage of the factory volume is doing useful work?
And conveyance does not count as useful work.
Yeah.
If you break the factory down into cubic meter sections and say… or smaller.
"Could be like one liter sections, and say, “Is a majority of this volume of doing useful work?” You’d be astounded at how bad most factories are."
"They’d be like maybe two or 3%, including our factory in Fremont."
So I think it’s possible to get to at least 10 times that of volumetric efficiency.
"So more like 30%ish, maybe more, and be 10x better, which means the factory can be 10 times smaller."
And then the other thing is how fast are things going through the factory?
It’s like speed and density.
A factory that’s moving at say twice the speed of another factory is equivalent to two factories basically.
And the company that will be successful is the company that with one factory can accomplish what other companies take two or three or four factories to do.
"So this is what we’re trying to do here is say, okay, how do we, with one factory achieve what maybe five or even 10 factories would normally be required to achieve?"
Yeah.
"I mean, basically Tesla is aiming to be the best at manufacturing of any company on Earth."
"This is the thing that’s actually most important in the long run I think, just from a company standpoint and from basically achieving sustainability as fast as possible."
"But I think also for long-term competitiveness, eventually every car company will have long range electric cars."
"Eventually every company will have autonomy, I think, but not every company will be a great at manufacturing."
"Tesla will be absolutely head and shoulders above anyone else in manufacturing, that is our goal."
Sure.
So essentially what this translates to based on what we know today is about a 75% reduction in the investment per kilowatt hour.
Or gigawatt hour.
It’s just basically four times better than the current state of the art to the best of our knowledge.
And I think there’s probably room to improve even beyond that.
Definitely.
Yeah.
"So we’re able to, from a volume standpoint, actually get what, in a smaller form factor than Giga Nevada, we’re able to get many times the cell output."
"So you can see basically we can get a terawatt hour in less space than it took to make a gigawatt hour, 150 gigawatt hours."
So this is pretty profound.
"I would actually not have thought this was possible several years ago, that we could actually get to a terawatt scale in less space than what we currently envisioned for doing 150 gigawatt hours."
Yeah.
So this is just talking about Tesla internal cell production.
"As I tweeted out earlier, we will continue to use our cell suppliers, Panasonic and LG and CATL."
And so this is a hundred gigawatt hours supplemental to what we buy from suppliers.
"And yeah, essentially, this does reduce our weighted average cost of a sale, but it allows us to make a lot more cars and a lot more stationary storage."
"And then long-term, we’re expecting to make on the order of a 3000 gigawatt hours or three terawatt hours per year."
"I think we’ve got a good chance of achieving this actually before 2030, but I’m highly confident that we could do it by 2030."
"But wait, there’s more."
Sand is silicon dioxide.
Yeah.
"Basically with silicon, the cookie crumbles and gets gooey."
That’s basically what happens.
Yeah.
And I’m not sure if you saw this.
Basically a dollar per kilowatt hours basically.
"If you use simple silicon, it’s dramatically less than even the silicon that is currently used in the batteries that are made today, and you can use a lot more of it."
Yeah.
It gets cheaper and longer range.
Okay.
"Sorry, I was going to say it’s tough to exactly figure out what the right analogy is to explain a cathode and anode."
But a bookshelf is probably a pretty good one in the sense that you need a stable structure to contain the ions.
"So you want a structure that does not crumble or get gooey, or basically that that holds its shape in both the cathode and the anode."
"As you’re moving these ions back and forth, it needs to retain its structure."
"So if it doesn’t retain a structure, then you lose cycle life and your battery capacity drops very quickly."
Yeah.
Big deal.
Yeah.
Sure.
"So in order to scale, we really need to make sure that we’re not constrained by total nickel availability."
"I actually spoke with the CEOs of the biggest mining companies in the world and said, “Please make more nickel, this is very important.” And so I think they are going to make more nickel."
I think we need to have a kind of a three-tiered approach to batteries.
"So starting with iron, that’s kind of like a medium range, and then nickel manganese as sort of a medium plus intermediate and then high nickel for long range applications like Cyber Truck and the semi."
"Something like a semi-truck, it’s extremely important to have high energy density in order to get long range."
"And just to give sort of iron up a bit more time, if you look at [inaudible 02:17:37] per kilogram at the cathode level of iron, it looks like nickel’s twice as good, but when you fully consider it at the pack level, everything else taken into account, nickel is about maybe 50 or 60% better than iron."
"So iron is a little better than it would seem, when you look at it at the pack level fully considered."
"It’s not as good as nickel, nickel’s like 50 to 60% better, but it’s actually pretty good."
Good for stationary storage and for medium range applications where energy density is not paramount.
"And then, like I said, for intermediate, it’s kind of a nickel manganese, and it’s a relatively straightforward to do a cathode that’s two-thirds nickel one third manganese, which would then allow us to make 50% more cell volume with the same amount of nickel."
It’s insanely complicated.
"It’s a small world journey of, “I am a nickel atom, what happens to me?” And it is crazy."
"You’re going around the world three times, there’s the moral equivalent of digging the ditch, filling the ditch and digging the ditch again, it’s total madness basically."
"And these things just grew up, they’re just kind of like legacy things, it’s like how it was done before and then they connected the dots but really didn’t think of the whole thing from a first principle standpoint saying, “How do we get from the nickel ore in the ground to the finished nickel product for a battery?” So we’ve looked at the entire value chain and said, “How can we make this as simple as possible?”"
Yeah.
"To be clear, cathode production would be part of our the Tesla cell production plant."
So it would just be basically raw materials coming from the mine and from raw materials in the mine out comes a battery.
So it’s important to note that there is a massive amount of lithium on earth.
So lithium is not like oil.
"There’s a massive amount of it, pretty much everywhere."
"In fact is there’s enough lithium in the United States to convert the entire United States fleet to electric, all the cars in the United States."
Like 300 million or something like that.
Every vehicle in the United States can be converted to electric using only lithium that is available in the United States.
"Yeah, what we already know is exist."
"Yeah, people haven’t been trying because it’s just widely available."
"But it is important to say, “Okay, what is the smartest way to take ores and extract the lithium and do so in an environmentally friendly way?” And we actually discovered… Again, looking at it a first principles physics standpoint, instead of just the way it’s always been done, is we found that we can actually use table salt, sodium chloride, to basically extract the lithium from the ores."
"Nobody’s done this before, to the best of my knowledge, nobody’s done this."
"And all the elements are reusable, it’s a very sustainable way of obtaining lithium."
And we actually got rights to a lithium clay deposit in Nevada.
"Over 10,000 acres."
"And then the nature of the mining is actually also very environmentally sensitive in that we sort of take a chunk of dirt out of the ground, remove the lithium, and then put the chunk of dirt back where it was."
"So it will look pretty much the same as before, it will not look like terrible."
"And yeah, it’ll be nice."
Yeah.
It’s pretty crazy.
"Yeah, that’s true."
"Actually, just what’s in Nevada."
"Basically, there’s so much damn lithium on Earth it’s crazy."
It’s one of the most common elements on the planet.
"To date, it’s been done by third parties, but we think we can recycle the batteries more effectively, especially since our batteries, we’re making the same battery as the thing we’re recycling."
Whereas third party recyclers have to consider batteries of all kinds.
Yeah.
"Long-term, new batteries will come from old batteries once the fleet reaches steady state."
"So there’s an architecture that we’ve been wanting to do at Tesla for a long time, and we’ve finally figured it out."
"And I think it’s the way that all electric cars in the future will ultimately be made, it’s the right way to do things."
So it starts with having a single piece casting for the front body and the rear body.
"And in order to do this, we commissioned the largest casting machine that has ever been made."
And it’s currently working just over the road at our Fremont plant.
It’s pretty sweet.
"Currently making the entire rear section of the car as a single piece, high pressure die-cast aluminum."
"And in order to do this, we actually had to develop our own alloy because we wanted a high strength casting alloy that did not require coatings or heat treatment."
This is a big deal for castings.
Especially with a large casting.
"If you heat treat it afterwards it tends to deform, it kind of does this like potato chip thing."
So it’s very hard to keep a large casting to have its shape.
"So in order to achieve this, there was no alloy that existed that could do this, so we developed our own alloy, a special allow of aluminum, that has high strength without heat treat and is very castable."
So that’s a great achievement of our materials team.
"In fact, in general, we’ve got a lot of advanced materials coming for Tesla, new alloys and materials that have never existed before."
"So, you’re basically making the front and rear of the car is a single piece and that then interfaces to what we call it, the structural battery."
Where the battery for the first time will have dual use.
The battery will both have the use as an energy device and as structure.
This is absolutely the way things are done.
In the early days of aircraft they would carry the fuel tanks as cargo.
So the fuel tanks actually were quite difficult to carry.
"They’re basically worse than cargo, you had to add to kind of bolt them down."
It was very difficult.
"And then somebody said, “Hey, what if we just make the fuel tank in wing shape?” So all modern airplanes, your wing is just a fuel tank in wing shape."
This is absolutely the way to do it.
"And then the fuel tanks serves this dual structure, and it’s no longer cargo."
It’s fundamental to the structure of the aircraft.
This was a major breakthrough.
We’re doing the same for cars.
So this is really quite profound.
Effectively the non cell portion of the battery has negative mass.
So we saved more mass than the rest of the vehicle than the non cell portion of the battery.
"So it’s like, “How do you really minimize the mass of a battery?"
Make it negative.
Make the non cell portion of battery pack negative.” So it also allows us to pack the cells more densely because we do not have intermediate structure in the battery pack.
"So instead of having these supports and stabilizers and stringers and structural elements in the battery, we now have a lot more space in the battery because the pack itself is structural."
"What we do essentially, instead of having just a filler that is a flame retardant, which is currently what is in the 3NY battery packs, we have a filler that is a structural adhesive, as well as flame-retardant."
So it effectively glues the cells to the top and bottom sheet.
And this allows you to do shear transfer between upper and lower sheet.
"Just like if you have a formula one craft or a racing boat, and you have carbon fiber face sheets and aluminum honeycomb between them, this gives you incredible stiffness and it’s really the way that any super fast thing works is you create basically a honeycomb sandwich with two face sheets."
This is actually even better than what aircraft do.
Because aircraft do not do this.
They can’t do this because fuel is liquid.
So in our case the batteries are solid.
"So we can actually use the steel shell case of the battery to transfer shear from the upper and lower face sheet, which makes for an incredibly stiff structure, even stiffer than a regular car."
"In fact, if this was a convertible that had no upper structure, that convertible will be stiffer than a regular car."
So it’s just really major.
So it improves the mass efficiency of the battery.
"And then those castings are also quite important because you want to transfer load into the structural battery pack in a very smooth, continuous way."
So you don’t put arbitrary point loads into the battery.
So you want to sort of feather the load out from the front and rear into the structural battery.
"It also allows us to move the cells closer to the center of the car, because we don’t have the… In the top one we’ve got all the supports and stuff, so the volumetric efficiency of the structural pack is as much better than a non-structural pack."
And we’re going to actually bring the cells closer to the center and because they’re closer to the center it reduces the probability of a side impact potentially contacting the cells because in any kind of side impact has to go further in order to reach the cells.
It also proves what’s called the polar moment of inertia.
Which is if you think of when there’s a ice skater arms out or arms in.
"Arms in, you rotate faster."
"So if you can bring things closer to the center, you reduce the polar moment of inertia and that means the car maneuvers better."
It just feels better.
"You won’t know why, but it just feels more agile."
So it’s really cool.
This is really major.
"Like it says, so 10% mass reduction in the body of the car, 14% range increase, 370 fewer parts."
"I really think that long-term in any cars that do not take this architecture will not be competitive,"
Yeah.
So major improvements on all fronts from the cell all the way to the vehicle.
Yeah.
So I think it’s pretty nice that investment per gigawatt hour reduction is 69%.
"I mean, who would have thought?"
"I mean, 0.420%, of course."
So what this enables us to do is achieve a new trajectory in the reduction of cell cost.
"And now to be clear, it will take us probably a year to 18 months to start realizing these advantages and to fully realize the advantages probably it’s about three years or thereabouts."
"So if we could do this instantly we would, but it just really bodes well for the future and means that the long-term scaling of Tesla and the sustainable energy products that we make will be massively increased."
"So, what tends to happen as companies get bigger is things tend to slow down, actually they’re going to speed up."
Yeah.
"Long-term we want to try to replace at least 1% of the total vehicle fleet on Earth, which is about 2 billion vehicles."
"So long-term, we want to try and make about 20 million vehicles a year."
Yep.
What does this mean for our future products?
"So we’re confident that long-term we can design and manufacturer a compelling $25,000 electric vehicle."
This has always been our dream from the beginning of the company.
"I even wrote a blog piece about it because our first car was an expensive sports car, then it was a slightly less expensive sedan, and then finally sort of a, I don’t know, mass market premium, the Model 3 and Model Y."
But it was always our goal to try to make an affordable electric car.
"And I think probably, like I said, about three years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous."
Yeah.
So we have and extreme performance and range.
"And we should probably talk about, more or less, Plaid."
What about that?
"So, yeah."
"Anyway, we took the latest Plaid out to Laguna Seco on Sunday, it got a minute 30, and we think probably there’s another three seconds or more to take off that time."
"So we’re confident the Model Plaid will achieve the best track time of any production vehicle ever, of any kind, two-door or otherwise."
And you can order it now.
And it’s available basically in the next year.
And now we’ll move to Q&A.
So we’ll invite a few people on stage.
"This is just a small portion of the team, but I thought it’d be great to show you some more of the team and when we do Q&A we can give various people different questions to answer."
"Actually, I don’t know either."
You can maybe get out of the car for two seconds and yell it at us.
How are we getting the questions?
"Oh, there are mics."
"Okay, great, great."
Okay.
We’ll definitely needs to give people mics cause otherwise there’s no way.
Sorry?
All right.
We’re going to pass some mics out.
"Oh, we don’t have a name for the $25,000 car yet."
"Yes, we will be manufacturing cells in Berlin."
Yep.
"Oh, you mean like the home HVA?"
Yeah.
That’s a pet project that I’d love to get going on.
"I don’t know, maybe we’ll start working on that next year."
"Because I just think, man, you could really make a way better home HVAC system that’s really quiet and super efficient, super energy efficient, and also has a way better filter for particles."
"And it works very reliably, and we’ve already developed that for the car."
So the heat pump in the Model Y is really pretty spectacular.
"It’s tiny, it’s efficient, it has to last for 15 years, it’s got to work in all kinds of conditions from the coldest winter to the hottest summer."
So we’ve actually already done a massive amount of the work necessary for a really kick-ass home HVAC.
And they could also stack them.
"So if you want to say, depending upon the size of your house or whatever, how much you need, you can just basically stack them and just have a very compelling, super efficient home HVAC."
And then you could also communicate with the car and it’ll know when you’re coming home.
"So it’s like, “Oh, I don’t need to keep the house cold all day, I’ll just cool it down because I knew you were coming home.” So the pack can communicate with the car and just really dial it into when you actually need cooling and heating."
It’ll be great.
We’ll try to do that.
Yeah.
"I agree, that would be really cool."
Yeah.
"Well, I don’t think there will be at ICE industry longterm."
"Well, I guess there might be like a few things that it’s a like curious thing."
"There’s still like some steam engines made somewhere, but they’re just basically sort of quirky collector’s items."
"I mean, that will be the future of the internal combustion engine car."
"Well, it’s hard to say what the volume exactly would be for the cyber truck."
The orders are gigantic.
"We have like, I don’t know, well over half a million orders, I think maybe six or 600,000."
"It’s a lot, basically, we stopped counting."
"So I think there’s probably room for, I don’t know, at least like a unit volume of like 250 to 300,000 a year, maybe more."
"Now, we are designing the cyber truck to meet the American spec."
"Because if you try to design a car to meet the super set of all global requirements you can’t make the cyber truck, it’s impossible."
"So it really is designed for the American market, but this is the biggest market."
Our North American market is the biggest market for pickup trucks by far or large pickup trucks.
"And then I think we’ll probably make an international version of cyber truck that’ll be kind of smaller, kind of like a tight Wolverine package."
"It’ll still be cooler, but it’ll be smaller because you just can’t make a giant truck like that for most markets."
"So, yeah, but it’s going to be great."
And I don’t know.
I think probably we’ll be able to sell directly in Texas.
"We do pretty well right now, but it is a bit weird not being able to actually conclude a transaction in Texas, but it’s got to be like a click on a server based in California."
"But weirdly we can do leasing in Texas, but not selling."
Hopefully that’ll get cleared up in the future.
I think it will have a very significant impact because it will stop the CO2 PPM from growing as it is every year.
"I should say, I try to view the whole climate thing as a science question as much as possible."
"Science, you always question your hypothesis, is it true?"
Is not true?
Or assign a probability to a given hypothesis.
And I should say that my original interest in electric vehicles predates the climate issue.
"When I was in high school, I thought, “Man, if we don’t figure out electric cars, the whole economy’s going to collapse when we run out of oil.” So we better figure out electric cars and sustainable energy or civilization’s going to crumble."
And then it was only later that the significance of the climate risk became apparent.
"And we were also able, using tracking and other types of technology to access a lot more fossil fuels than previously thought, which is helpful for lowering the cost of gasoline, but it’s pretty bad for the total tonnage of CO2 that you could put in the atmosphere."
It’s now greatly beyond what people previously thought.
"As we were just going through this presentation, it is a absolutely monumental task to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy."
"The entire global economy is still more than 99% dependent on, or call it roughly 99% dependent on, fossil fuels."
"So although electric cars get a lot of press right now, as a percentage of the total global fleet it’s practically nothing."
"I would say yes, less than 1% of the global fleet is electric right now."
Because of two billion cars and trucks and whatnot in use.
So there’s a massive amount of work ahead.
"Just insane, like hard to comprehend how much work is ahead to get the new vehicle production to be sustainable, to massively increase the amount of stationary storage, which is critical because renewable energy is intermittent, wind, and solar is intermittent, sometimes the wind doesn’t blow and this obviously sun doesn’t shine at night, so you got to have batteries, a massive, massive number of batteries."
That’s true.
It is a false dichotomy to say that it’s either prosperity or sustainability.
"This is often used by oil and gas to say like, “Oh, well, do you want people to lose their jobs?"
Do you want to lower people’s standards of living?
"Do you want to make all these economic sacrifices really in order to have sustainability?” And the reality, as Drew was saying, is that sustainable energy is going to be lower cost, not higher cost than fossil fuels."
"Well actually, there’s a lot of companies in China that I think are doing great work with electric vehicles and also with stationary storage, although we don’t see that much in the US yet, but I think probably we will in the future."
"I don’t know, obviously we’re doing everything we can to encourage other companies to move to sustainable transport and also make stationary storage batteries."
"We made our patents freely available, we really try to tell these companies, “Hey, you really need to do this, or you won’t exist in the future,” but they don’t believe it."
So we’ve talked until we’re blue in the face.
What are we supposed to do?
But we really are hopeful that other companies will also do what we’re doing and that will make a sustainable future come sooner.
Where are you?
Are you there?
"Okay, great."
"It’s like ventriloquism here, we just get the sound out of the speaker and can’t tell where the heck it’s coming from."
"Well, I mean, there are batteries in limited production right now, that do exceed 400 watt hours per kilogram, which I think is about the number you need for a decent range, medium range aircraft."
"And I think our batteries will, over time, start to approach the 400 watt hours per kilogram range as well."
"So yeah, I mean, I think over time, we’ll see all modes of transport, with the ironic exception of rockets, transition to sustainability or to electric basically."
"On the rocket front, what we’re planning to do is, about 80% of Starship is liquid oxygen and we’re actually already running a power line to be able to use wind power to create the liquid oxygen."
"So we’re making some decent progress on sustainability on the rocket front, but there’s just no way to have an electric rocket."
"And it’s important for the future of life and consciousness, that we become a multi planet species, so got to keep doing that."
"Yeah, indeed."
The spice must flow.
The new spice.
I don’t know.
I’m not sure.
"I guess we can try to basically overdo it in cell production and perhaps supply cells to others, but we do see the fundamental constraint, as total cell production."
"That’s why we’re putting so much effort into making cells and kind of trying to reinvent every aspect of cell production, from mining the ore, to a complete battery pack, because it’s the fundamental constraint."
"We’re not getting into the cell business just for the hell of it, it’s because it’s the fundamental constraint, it’s the thing that is the limiting factor for rapid growth."
"But we could certainly try to overdo it on cell production and perhaps sell cells to others, although we are going at absolute top speed, so it’s not like we’re holding it back."
"I think just making really efficient cars that have lower drag coefficient, low rolling resistance, efficient powertrains, I mean, that’s kind of what we’ve done in order to make iron phosphate still have a good range."
"So the iron phosphate’s a lower energy density solution, but while there are some limitations on the total amount of nickel produced every year, there’s really no limit on the iron."
There’s so much iron it’s ridiculous.
"So you can really scale up iron phosphate at a raw materials basis, more than you can nickel."
Yeah.
"In fact, if there’s anything that you guys want to comment on, feel free to step forward and say something."
Talk louder.
"We haven’t really thought about it that much, but I suppose it’s probably something we should think about."
We will be providing a title on the Tesla’s.
So we’re providing more music sources that people can choose from and just generally trying to improve the entertainment experience in the cars.
"And I think actually as we go to a more autonomous future, the importance of entertainment and productivity will become greater and greater."
"I mean, to the degree that if you’re just basically sitting in your car, the car is fully autonomous and driving somewhere, the car is essentially your chauffeur and then the things that become important are, okay, well let’s have good entertainment and if you want to do some productivity stuff, then that actually starts to become much more important because you’re no longer spending your attention driving the car."
So it will be extremely important in the future.
Yeah.
"The first one, I think we already answered."
"If we’re able to make enough cells, which we’ll try to do, we will supply other companies."
"It’s definitely not an intentional effort to keep the cells to ourselves, if we can make enough for other companies, we will supply them."
"And we were trying to do the right thing for advancing the sustainable energy, whatever that is."
"Vehicle to grid, we get asked that a lot."
"I think one of the things that’s important to note, is vehicle to grid, unless you have a power cutoff, you need to cut off your main supply to the grid, otherwise, if you lose the power in your house, you’ll basically just backflow energy to the grid."
"So just having a reversal in the power flow, does not actually keep the lights on, you need a whole separate system to cut off power to the grid."
And I think there’s also the case that people really want the freedom to be able to drive and to charge at their house.
"And it’s obviously very problematic if you get to morning and your car, instead of being charged, it discharged into the house and then you’re sort of, “Okay, now I can either drive or use the battery to power my house.”"
"I think it’s actually going to be better for people’s freedom of action, to have a power wall and a car separate, and then everything works that."
"You basically combine that with solar, either solar retrofit or solar glass roof, and local battery storage, so you basically become your own utility and then the car can be charged also with solar."
"I think that’s the stuff that works, that said, we can certainly do vehicle to grid, I think we can basically enable that with software in Europe or something, right?"
Yeah.
"Honestly, a vehicle to grid sounds good, but I think actually has a much lower utility than people think."
I think very few people would actually use vehicle to grid.
"With the original roadster, we had vehicle to grid capabilities, nobody used it."
How do we find the engineers to do all these things?
"Well, I guess we recruit a lot of engineers from all parts of the world."
I think Tesla has a good reputation for doing exciting engineering and that tends to attract a lot of the top engineers in the world because they know that their efforts at Tesla will really serve the greater good and we’re super hardcore about engineering.
"Tesla is first and foremost an engineering company, it’s like hardcore engineering is what we do."
The sheer amount of hardcore engineering done at Tesla is insane.
"And if you look at say, there’s various surveys done of engineering schools, where do you want to go, what’s your top choices?"
"And actually the top two choices last few years, have been Tesla and SpaceX."
"So sometimes it’s Tesla first and sometimes SpaceX first, but those are the two top ones."
Absolutely.
"And like you said, the battle is far from over."
Less than 1% of the global automotive fleet has been converted to electric and even maybe less than 0.1% of stationary storage has been done.
"So stationary storage has barely begun, converting the global vehicle fleet to electric, has barely begun."
"So there’s still a massive amount of engineering work to be done at Tesla and other companies, to accelerate this transition to sustainability."
Yeah.
"I mean, I think certainly we will try to give back as much as possible to the customers."
"It’s not like Tesla’s profitability is crazy high, our average profitability for last four quarters, is maybe 1%."
"So just to be clear, it’s not like we’re minting money."
"Our evaluation makes it seem like we are, but we’re not."
"So we do want to try to make the price as competitive as we can, without losing money."
"If you keep losing money, you’ll just die."
"So this thing called profit is just like, we need to bring in more money than we spend, otherwise we’re dead."
Yeah.
"I mean, it’s important to sort of separate the difference between affordability and value for money or desirability of the product."
"So for a lot of people, they want to buy a Tesla, they simply don’t have enough money."
"We could make the car infinitely desirable, but if somebody does not have enough money, they can’t buy it."
Sometimes people kind of forget this.
"People have to have enough money to buy the car and just making a car super desirable, but expensive, does not mean they can afford it."
So it’s absolutely critical that we make cars that people can actually afford.
"Go through some of these things, scroll down or something."
Yeah.
We’re already pretty close.
"And then factoring in total cost of ownership and the fact that electric vehicles require much less servicing and are way cheaper to run, when you look at total cost of ownership."
"And you can always lease a car, so if you just lease a car or get a loan for a car, you’ve got your sort of monthly payments and then your cost for either gasoline or electricity and your cost of servicing and the fully considered cost of electric car is much less than a gasoline car of the same nominal purchase price."
"I mean, that said, maybe on the order of three years, when we can do lower cost, like a $25,000 car, I think that will be basically on par, maybe slightly better than a comparable gasoline car."
So I think maybe it’s on the order of three years-ish.
We sort of have said that already.
Do we have some ability to scroll through this?
Just scroll away.
Yeah.
Just scroll until we’ve got stuff that we haven’t covered.
"Yeah, a lot of the things we’ve already asked really."
We literally just answered that.
"Guys, is there anything you want to add to … Maybe we can go through everyone and maybe say what you’re doing and say a few words."
I don’t know.
Massive problem.
Yeah.
"And obviously, if you care about solving sustainability and doing hardcore engineering, definitely come work for Tesla."
Since when Scott?
Exactly.
"We’re wrong, just the question of how wrong."
Trying to be less wrong.
All right.
"Well, I guess thank you everyone for coming."
I hope you liked the presentation.
Very exciting future ahead.
"We’re going to work our damnedest to transition the world to sustainable energy as quickly as possible, and your support and help is key to that success."
"So thanks again, super appreciated and look forward to the next event."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"First of all, I’d like to thank the Tesla team for exceptional execution in the second quarter."
"Despite tremendous difficulties, they’ve done an incredible job and it’s an honor to work with such a great team."
"I mean, there were so many challenges, too numerous to name, but they got it done."
And it just what a great group to work with.
"Like I said, it’s just an honor to work such a great team."
"So as a result, we were able to achieve a fourth consecutive profitable quarter."
"And although the automotive industry was down about 30% year over year in the first half of the year, we managed to grow deliveries in the first half of the year."
"So despite that massive industry decline, we actually went up."
We’re also very excited to announce that we’re going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas.
It’s going to be a right near Austin.
It’ll be about … I’ll go into better detail on this and I’m sure there will be a lot of questions.
But the location is five minutes from Austin International Airport and 15 minutes from downtown Austin.
It’s about 2000 acres and we’re going to make it a factory that it’s going to be stunning.
It’s right on the Colorado River.
"So we’re going to have a boardwalk where there’ll be a hiking, biking trail."
It’s going to basically be an ecological paradise.
"Birds in the trees, butterflies, fish in the stream."
And it will be open to the public as well so not closed and only Tesla.
"So if anyone’s interested in working at Giga Texas, engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please let us know."
"We’re going to be doing a major, major factory there."
"And it’s also where we’ll be doing cyber truck there, the Tesla semi, and we’ll be doing Model 3 and Y for the Eastern half of North America."
"Now at the same time, I want to say we will continue to grow in California, but we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the Western half of North America."
"And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also makes sense in California."
"So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California and just emphasize we’ll continue to grow in California, but we’ll be creating a massive factory and cyber truck and semi programs in Texas."
"And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, economic development team and the Governor, really I was super impressed."
"The Tesla team was super impressed, and we will for sure strongly consider Tulsa for a future expansion of Tesla down the road."
Let’s see.
Is there anything more you want to say about?
"This is a lot of information, so."
"Anything else, guys?"
All right.
"Well, I’m sure there will be lots of questions."
We’ve already started work on the facility so some initial construction work it’s already underway out of this weekend.
Let’s see.
Moving on to other subjects.
"Solar, we recently adjusted the pricing about retrofit solar."
So Tesla solar is the lowest cost solar in the United States.
And we added a lowest cost guarantee and a money back guarantee.
"So we’re very confident that people will love our solar product, whether it’s this whole retrofit or solar roof."
Our solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average.
"After the federal tax credit, Tesla Solar now costs $1.49 per watt, and it’s a very simple, highly automated single click experience."
"So definitely think about a Tesla, whether you want a new roof, Tesla solar roof, or you want solar on your existing roof."
"Either way, we’re the company to go to."
And then you can also get a power wall and have energy independence and be your own utility.
So I think that product is really coming together and it’s only going to get better later this year.
So just very excited about that business potential.
"On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car with more than 400 miles range."
So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA certified range of 402 miles.
"I mean, basically you can drive from LA to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over when you arrived and this was at highway speeds."
"So you don’t have to do anything, drive slowly or anything."
You just drive it.
You can just drive normally and go very long distances.
"And then for full self driving, we launched traffic lights and stop signs, and we’re continuing to improve that to make them more robust."
And we’re currently testing also driving software for intersections and city streets and narrow streets.
So I personally test the latest [inaudible 00:05:54] of full self driving software when I drive my car.
"And it is really, I think, profoundly better than people realize."
"Yeah, really profoundly better."
It’s amazing.
"So it’s almost getting to the point where I can go from my house to work with no interventions, despite going through construction and widely varying situations."
"So this is why I am very confident about full self driving, the functionality being complete by the end of this year, because I’m literally driving it."
"In conclusion, I’d like to again say thanks for all the hard work of the Tesla team achieving our first four year of profitability in the company history."
It was incredibly difficult and just as a result of the hard work of a lot of people from Tesla worldwide.
"And yeah, just think about the next 12 to 18 months, we’ll have three new factories in place."
"Things are looking great with a Giga Berlin and we’ll have cyber truck, semi, Roadster, full self driving."
There’s so much to be excited about.
"It’s really hard to kind of put into this call, but the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the autonomy and the manufacturing engineering front is mindblowing."
"And then of course, there’s [inaudible 00:07:40] Day, which is coming up pretty soon."
And I think that’s really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see.
"So with that, thanks again for your support in our long term mission."
And we’re looking forward to having a great journey with you to create amazing products and continue scaling it.
"And yeah, I think I’ve never been more optimistic or excited about the future of Tesla and then the history of the company."
Thank you.
"Well, I don’t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what’s announced because I think we want to reserve that for product launches."
It would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher capacity passenger vehicle of some kind.
"These are likely things at some point, but I do think there’s a long way to go with 3 and Y and with cyber truck and semi."
It’s a long way to go with those.
I think we’ll do the obvious things.
Right now I thought FST as just overwhelmingly the most important thing.
"I think the upgrading of the fleet to full self driving, especially with an over the air software update, may go down as the biggest asset value increase in history as a step change."
"Maybe there’s something bigger, but it certainly would be one of the biggest."
I can’t think of anything bigger.
"So overnight, a million depending exactly when it happens and when it’s allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions."
"… regulatory jurisdictions you’d have like, I don’t know, at least a few million cars suddenly becoming five times more valuable or something like that."
"So like five times higher utility to go from like 12 hours a week of utility, something like that."
"That’s how many hours they used, 260, something like that."
Everything else is pretty small by comparison.
"Now, when things do become full self-driving, so what are people going to do in the car?"
"Well, I guess they’re probably going to do productivity and entertainment of some kind, watch movies, play games, and do work."
That’s in the future.
We’re already putting some games and stuff on the car just for fun.
Yeah.
But they’re all very tiny compared with… The step change to full self driving depending upon high calculated is probably worth at least a hundred thousand dollars per car.
That’s a lot of software you have to sell in the app store or whatever.
"Well, the actual major milestone that’s happening right now is really transition of the autonomy system of the cars like AI, if you will, from thinking about things in like two and a half D. It’s basically taking isolated pictures and doing image recognition on pictures that are partially correlated in time but not very well."
"And transitioning to kind of a 4D, which is video essentially."
You’re thinking about the world in three dimensions and the fourth dimension being time.
"So that architectural change, which has been underway for some time but has not really been rolled out to anyone in the production fleet is what really matters for full self driving."
"What we’ve been doing thus far is really just going with 2D, mostly 2D, and like I said, not well correlated in time."
So it’s just hard to convey just how much better a fully 4D system does work.
"It’s capable of things that if you’re just looking at things as individual pictures as opposed to video, basically you go from like individual pictures to a surround video."
This is fundamental.
The car will seem to have just like a giant improvement.
"We’ll probably roll it out later this year, but be able to do your traffic lights, stop, turns, everything pretty much."
"Then it will be a long March of Nines, essentially."
How many nines of reliability are okay?
"So it’s definitely way better than human, but how much better than human does it need to be?"
That’s actually going to be the real work.
There’s just a massive amount of work with each kind of order of magnitude of reliability.
"You’ll see a [inaudible 00:20:12] happen and if you plot the points on a curve, it’ll be kind of obvious where it’s headed."
"AI in general, I think is something… I’ve been banging this AI drum for a decade, we should be concerned about where AI is going."
The people I see being the most wrong about AI are the ones who are very smart because they can’t imagine that a computer could be way smarter than them.
That’s the flow in their logic.
They’re just way dumber than they think they are.
"A massive amount of effort into manufacturing engineering, the machine that makes the machine is probably a 1000%, maybe 10000% more engineering required for the factory than for the product itself."
So we’re certainly making progress.
"I mean, battery and powertrain Gigafactory in Nevada is on an alien dreadnought version 0.5, something like that."
Starting to approach version one.
We’re getting way better at making cars.
You can see that in Giga Shanghai.
You’ll see that even more with Berlin and we’re really changing the design of the car in order to make it more manufacturable.
The fundamental architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin.
"It may look the same, but the internals will be quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturally than what we’ve done to date."
"Drew, would you like to add to that?"
Yeah.
Vertical integration is extremely important for this.
"But the supply chain, if you put a GPS tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable product, it would look insane."
"It would be like, wow, it went around the world like six times."
"With vertical integration, maybe you can only go around the world once."
It’s a huge improvement.
"I think if we could get vertical integration, we could probably get you an order magnitude improvement."
Yeah.
[inaudible 00:08:29].
It’s a better factory for less money and less time.
Yes.
[crosstalk 00:09:21].
"In fact, it’s like we want to be super respectful of people’s labor."
"If we’re asking somebody to do something, are we sure it’s useful?"
Are we asking them to spend their time in a way that is respectful of their time?
"But it’s like, wow, the potential for improvement is just tremendous."
"I just want to be clear, here at Tesla, we love manufacturing."
It’s awesome.
I really think more smart people should be working on manufacturing.
It’s like-
Yes.
We love it.
We do.
Absolutely.
It’s actually extremely exciting and fulfilling to design new production systems.
"I think that for some reason I kind of got a bad rap, especially in the US for a long time."
"I think people don’t think that manufacture… They thought of manufacturing as like, “Oh, it’s just some boring, just making copies or whatever.” But actually there’s far more opportunity for innovation in manufacturing than in the product itself."
Order magnitude.
"If there’s one thing that comes out of this call, it’s like, “Hey, if you want to help us invent amazing manufacturing techniques and have them put into the product itself.” It’s not like you just get tossed the product and say, “Hey, make this product.” And it’s kind of a lousy design."
"If you’re a manufacturer, you get to change the product design and say, “Hey, this product you’re asking me to manufacturer is dumb.” They’re like, “Great, let’s fix it.”"
"So at Tesla, if you work on manufacturing and engineering, you don’t just get forced [inaudible 00:11:28]."
You get to change the product design.
So it’s super exciting.
"And we evolved [Alliance 00:26:37] even after their book, this rapid evolution of the production system."
Yeah.
"So the long term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think will be manufacturing."
"Well, right now, zero."
"But longterm, a lot."
Yeah.
It’s the biggest property.
True.
"Yeah, I can’t emphasize enough."
"I think long term, Tesla energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla automotive."
I mean the energy business collectively is bigger than the automotive business.
"So you say like, how big is the energy sector?"
Bigger than automotive.
"In order to achieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think is going to be primarily solar and by wind and those are intermittent."
So you need to have a lot of batteries to store the energy because the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine.
"There’s like three elements of the sustainable energy future, wind and solar, sustainable energy generation, battery storage, and electric transport."
Those three things.
The mission of Tesla is to accelerate sustainable energy.
I can’t emphasize enough the… Yeah.
Battery and solar will both be enormous and they kind of have to be in order for us to have a sustainable future.
We’ve got a great product roadmap on that front as well.
[inaudible 00:29:09] the Megapack is very well received.
"Yeah, if you want to talk about that."
That’s a bad word.
High frequency trading should be called front running.
We’re not doing that.
"Yeah, it’s just grid stabilization at the millisecond level."
So it just ensures that things are super smooth.
"It’s like UPS, an uninterruptible power supply, of a normal size."
"But just ensures that the grid has smooth sailing, and the batteries, the computers won’t interact with each other, and make sure that they’re working together to make the grid as smooth."
"And this can be done with the Power Walls and the Megapacks and the Power Packs all working together, and interacting with third party systems as well."
It’s necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.
"Yeah, the real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price."
That’s a real limit.
"So, that’s where… We can talk a little more about this on Battery Day, because this is the fundamental scaling constraint."
And any part of that supply chain or processing at the cell level will be the limiting factor.
"So, whatever it may be, anywhere from mining to refining."
"There’s many steps, in refining, to cathode and anode formation, cell formation, whatever the trouble point is, that will set the growth rate."
"And so, we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others."
And there’s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.
Yeah.
"And just, there’s two general classes of cell."
There’s iron phosphate and then the nickel-based.
"The nickel-based cells have higher energy density, so longer range."
"Obviously those are needed for something like the semi, where every unit of mass that you add in battery pack you have to subtract in cargo."
So it’s very important to have mass-efficient and long range pack for batteries.
"However, what we’re seeing with our passenger vehicles is our power train efficiency, tire efficiency, drag coefficient… If all of the things, HVAC, going into a heat pump, [inaudible 00:34:55] our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 in China."
And that’ll be in volume production later this year.
"So we think that getting a range that is in the high 200’s… Basically, but we think, probably get a range of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into a whole bunch of power train and other vehicle efficiencies."
And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and other projects that require higher energy density.
"So, yeah, [inaudible 00:35:49] two supply chains that you can tap into, iron phosphate or nickel."
"We use very little cobalt in our system already, and that may trend to zero [inaudible 00:36:03]."
So it’s really about nickel.
"Well, I’d just like to re-emphasize [inaudible 00:36:32], any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel."
Okay?
"Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel, and don’t wait for nickel to go back to some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever."
"Go for efficient, as environmentally friendly nickel mining, at high volume."
Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way.
"So, hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies."
Please get nickel.
"With regard to passenger vehicles, I think the new normal for range is going to be, just in U.S. EPA terms, approximately 300 miles."
"So I think people will really come to expect that, as some number close to 300 miles, as normal."
That’s a standard expectation.
"Because you do need to take into account, is it very hot outside?"
Or very cold?
Or are you driving up a tall mountain with a full load?
And it’s… People don’t want to get to a destination with like 10 miles range.
They want some reasonable margin.
"So, I think 300 is going to be really… or close to 300 is going to be a new normal."
"Call it 500 kilometers, basically."
Roughly.
Version 0.9 [inaudible 00:39:13] at least.
"Yeah, I mean, at the heart of being competitive with insurance is, what is the accuracy of your information?"
"Are you dealing with… Are you forced to assess people statistically, looking in the rear view mirror?"
"Or can you assess people individually, looking ahead with smart projections?"
"And inform the driver of how they may reduce their… what actions they can take to reduce their insurance, as Zack was alluding to."
"It’s like, okay, you’re driving too fast."
You’re doing this or that or the other thing.
"It’s like, if you want to pay more for insurance you can, but if you want to pay less, then please don’t drive so crazy."
And people can make a choice.
"Okay, they want to drive aggressively."
In that case it will be higher insurance.
"They want to be more careful in their driving, it’ll be pay less."
It’s just also actually very helpful for us to have a feedback loop to see what is driving insurance expense.
"A lot of it is just, you have like a little fender bender, and the next fender bender, because of the way that the body or collision repair is being done, costs $15,000 or something crazy."
"We can actually adjust the design of the car, and adjust how the repair is done, to actually have the fundamental cost of solving that problem be less."
"So this has helped us unearthed a bunch of silly things we were doing, basically."
Without realizing it.
This is a problem in general with insurance.
"It’s like, if insurance is like, all you can eat, then the feedback loop for improvement is weak."
So this gives us a great feedback loop for improvement.
It gives us basically a fundamentally better insurance product.
"I’d also like to say, in the spirit of recruiting, if there’s one thing I’d like to come out of this call, it’s that a lot of great people want to join Tesla."
That’s the number one thing I’d like out of this call.
"And on the insurance front, I want to be clear, we’re building a great, major insurance company."
"If you’re interested in revolutionary insurance, please join Tesla."
"I would love to have some high energy actuaries, especially."
I have great respect for the actuarial profession.
You guys are great at math.
Please join Tesla.
"Especially if you want to change things, and you’re annoyed by how slow the industry is."
This is the place to be.
We want revolutionary actuaries.
"Well, I think we actually achieve both when you factor in autonomy."
I think we can go way beyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentially almost everyone when factoring in autonomy.
"But that was really a mega game-changer, [inaudible 00:52:42] changer."
Yeah.
It is important for people to distinguish between two things.
"There’s value for money that a product has, and then there’s affordability."
"And even if you rail value for money and have value for money, infinite."
"If people do not have enough money in the bank account to buy the car, they simply cannot."
So then you just have this awesome thing and nobody can buy.
so it is important to make the car affordable.
We will not succeed in our mission if we do not make cars affordable.
The thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are not affordable enough.
We need me to fix that.
"So we’re all making progress in that regard, just steadily making progress."
"So we need to not go bankrupt, obviously that’s important because that will fail in our mission."
But we’re not trying to be super profitable either.
Obviously profitability is like one or 2%.
It’s not crazy.
Last quarter was only 0.1%.
So we want to be profitable.
"I think just, we want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible."
That’s what we’re trying to achieve.
Demand is not our problem.
Definitely not.
We do have some production supply chain challenges we’re trying to solve right now.
"For example, the Model Y rear body casting, obviously, because it’s new technology, it’s been tricky to maintain rate and keep growing the rate for Model Y casting."
Which it’s a two piece casting and there’s about half a dozen other parts that are added on that will transition to a one piece casting.
If I can predict super excited about this.
We’re going to have the world’s biggest casting press is getting assembled right now actually in Fremont for the Model Y rear body casting.
It’s enormous and it looks awesome.
So the things that are troubling us right now are not demand that they are just a bunch of fire fighting on supply chain and production issues.
Sorry.
"Yeah, don’t worry about demand."
That’s not the issue.
Yeah.
It’s not [inaudible 00:56:21] demand it’s really just a production issue.
"It’s pretty hard when you’ve got a global supply chain and it’s whatever the most effective part of that global supply chain is, that sets your rate."
So the number of rabbits we’ve had to pull out of hat for supply chain is insane.
Team’s done an amazing job.
So I think it also some of our server costs were related to having to use a lot of airplanes to get parts around because of parts shortages.
"So hopefully get use for your airplanes, that will improve our costs."
But it’s a dramatic feed supply right now.
That’s where we are now.
"Okay, well, we can’t say too much about this, except that there will be local cell production."
And that will serve the needs of the Berlin factory.
[inaudible 00:13:19].
Those who know Europe will know what I’m talking about.
Yeah.
Have you seen her with [inaudible 00:14:46].
Thank you.
So Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
This is the first time we have achieved positive gap net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
"Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, while wrapping two major products."
What we’ve learned from this is that… We’ve actually learned a lot here.
"After the Model 3 ramp from three years ago, our new products get ramped faster and become profitable sooner."
"In Q1, we produced more model wise in the first quarter than Model 3 in Fremont in the first two quarters."
"Thus far, and Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1."
"More surprisingly, in other words, we’re ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already."
"Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven’t achieved with any product in the past."
"Regarding autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to early access users in March and to all US customers with full stop driving package just last week."
Our cars will now automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to proceed.
"I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel that it is probably a safety improvement."
We are collecting data from over a million intersections every month at this point.
This number will grow exponentially as more people get the updates and as more people start driving again.
Soon we will be collecting data from over a billion intersections per month.
All of those confirmations are training annual net.
"Essentially, the driver when driving and taking action is effectively labeling reality as they drive and making the neural net better and better."
I think this is an advantage that no one else has and we’re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined.
I think this is difficult to fully appreciate.
"It’s the reason, I have to say, it’s very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because everyone is training Google all the time with their searches."
"So when you’re searching something and you click on a link, you’re training Google every time you do that."
It’s just very difficult for any new search engine to compete on that basis.
"So all those confirmations are creating a neural net and soon cars will be able to drive through an intersection without a confirmation as well as to make turns, and I feel extremely confident that it will be possible to do a drive from your home to your office most of the time with no interventions by the end of the year."
We can almost do this already with the leading edge alpha builds that are driving the car.
"So let’s see, on another technology front, or fronts, we increased the range of Model S and X yet again, this time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X."
It should be said that actually the real Model X range is 400 miles.
"But when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately the EPA left the car door open and the keys in the car, and they did this overnight."
"And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost 2% of its range, and as a result had a 391 on the test."
"As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we’ll redo the test and we’re actually in the confident that we will achieve a 400 mile or greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months, the true range of the Model S for the past two months has been 400 miles."
And of course we’re not stopping there.
"We’ll always continue pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and all the little details that makes a Tesla special."
"For model Y, we introduced the revolutionary two piece rear underwater casting, that we’re going to making a single piece casting a later this year."
"Meaning essentially, the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, which no casting of the size of complexity has ever been done before."
"In fact, there isn’t even anything that is on par with the two piece casting for the Model Y."
So we’re really pushing the envelope on the vehicle’s structural engineering and manufacturing.
"I’m very excited about this approach, as it allows us to reduce the weight, the cost and improve NVH."
"It’s better in every way, essentially."
"For the model I also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range."
"So the Model Y has remarkable range on par with, in fact, probably slightly better than, I guess, the Model 3, despite being a bigger car that weighs more, and the heat pump is a key contributor to that."
It is especially excellent at low temperature driving.
And the feedback we’re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.
We’re confident that this product will be our best selling product ever.
"So in conclusion, and just looking at looking forward, I guess this is a forward looking statement."
"We are absolutely continuing our model wide capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai, and here in Fremont when they will let us continue."
"Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, but you can count on our products will be even more competitive over time."
"While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite."
We are absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
"And we’re really looking forward to being, in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and Europe at a capacity of well over a million units a year."
"So there’s a [inaudible 00:08:59] to look forward to, and we can’t wait to tell you what’s going to happen."
Thank you.
"I think we will offer full stop driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year."
"I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option, as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the future and we are confident that is an investment that will pay off to the consumer, to the benefit of the consumer, and in my opinion, buying the FSD option is something people will not regret doing."
"Yeah, absolutely."
I should mention at a high level our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness.
That is our goal.
We think that’s the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.
"It’s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty, the guest loyalty."
"Our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we’re confident that if we were to behave like that then customers, in turn, will behave the same way to us."
Yeah.
"We are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China, and we’re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3 basically tomorrow China time, so the day after tomorrow California time, but tomorrow China time."
That will be a price below the subsidy limit.
We feel confident that that will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
"Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company."
One always has to do that in a crisis.
"Just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do, and we came to conclusion that the right move is actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in the future and new technologies, even though it is risky."
We’ve talked to some of our key investors and they support that approach as well.
I think that there’s clearly an uncertain future ahead.
"It’s a bit of a bumpy road, but I think the longterm prospects are extremely good."
Anything you guys want to add?
Yeah.
Touchless delivery.
Yeah.
The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone.
You can order a car and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paperwork and everything done.
That’s it.
Effortless.
"And they’re doing it, yes."
"In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this is something you can do, because normally buying a car is quite a pain."
"For most people, they would rather go to the dentist than buy a new car."
"Actually my dentist is great, but it’s really like quite an arduous thing."
"When the typical retail experience with buying a new car is more painful to people than having a root canal, then you have to say, whoa."
"For Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something from the Apple app store or ordering something on Amazon, except it’s a car."
Yeah.
In five minutes.
"If you really went fast, I think you could order a car probably in 90 seconds."
"Yeah, actually."
We don’t want to preempt Battery Day.
"We want to leave the exciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of exciting news to tell, and I think it would be one of the most exciting days in Tesla’s history."
We’re just trying to figure out the right timing for that.
We think probably the right timing will be probably the third week of May.
"I’m not giving a firm date, but we think that probably that’s the right timing, and depending upon what we’re allowed to do, it’ll either be in California or Texas."
Absolutely.
"There’s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential, with the fleet out there that could upgrade to turn on autopilot, basic autopilot or Full Self-Driving, and that’s something we will enable just as a support in-app purchase, or as we talked about earlier, towards the end of the year as a subscription."
That’s just a lot of untapped potential there.
"That’s not in the deferred revenue line obviously, but is certainly a great deal of deferred potential that we think is a large portion which is likely to reach fruition."
"Well, it’s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be."
I think very few people would have predicted the unexpected sort of roundhouse that Covid came up with that sort of came out of nowhere.
"I think in the absence of some massive force majeure event, like quite massive, I think probably 50% is the likely number."
It’s possible that it’s 40%.
"I would be very shocked if it’s less than 40%, even with a force majeure, short of World War Three."
I think we’ll announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month.
We may not as soon as next month.
That’s not a prediction.
It’s just saying that could happen.
"It will certainly be within three months, and possibly one month."
That would be in the US.
"As for how many will be in five years, I don’t know right now what that number would be."
"I guess several more than there are today, but I’m not sure what exactly it would be in five years, but some number more than today."
Yes.
And arguably could be start being called Tera.
"We were actually gaining interest momentum with the solar roof before Covid, and Covid essentially shut us down, both from the ability to install and the ability to get permits."
"The permit offices were closed, and we were shelter-in-place, live-in-place."
"We obviously cannot install if you can’t get permits and you can’t physically do it, it’s physically impossible."
"But I think the longterm trend for solar roof is extremely good, and I’m confident that let’s say within the next, I don’t know, year or maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of a thousand a week."
That’s not in the middle of winter or something.
"Allowing for seasonality, it’s hard to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice, but in spring I think it’s installing, which is the hard part."
"We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit a thousand a week gross build rate for the solar glass roof already, so that’s not a problem."
"It’s building up the install teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry installers, and internally we want to have at least a thousand solar roof install teams, taking a week or perhaps a little less than a week to do an install, which gets you a thousand a week roof installations."
"We see demand is good, production is good, so it’s really all about the install."
"Then, like I said, also building up the training, the very diverse group of companies in the roofing industry, to also install solar roof, that I think will allow us to scale far beyond a thousand a week."
"We’re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America, so we do expect this to be a product that is international, and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from China on the solar roof."
We’re confident that this will be a very significant product for the company over time.
"Well as I said on Twitter, I’m personally extremely excited to build a kick ass HVAC system that also has a sort of hospital grade particle filtration, basically HEPA filtration, that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi, and also neutralizes-"
… and it also neutralizes acidic alkaline gases; that is quiet and efficient.
And these are all things we’ve achieved in that car.
"By the way, in fact, I don’t know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S and X are the only cars in the world that have a hospital operating room-grade HEPA filters built in."
"They’re very big, but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars."
Yeah.
It’s not like Model 3 and Y… They’re no slouches.
"Model 3 and Y, they’re way better than any other car to the best of my knowledge."
"They’re not quite as good as hospital operating room, but they’re extremely good."
Way better than any other normal car.
"And we’re continuing to improve the filters on 3 and Y. I believe these actually have a big effect on health, even in normal, just day-to-day living."
It’s reducing particle count and it has an effect on allergies and all sorts of things.
"Air quality is incredibly important, even in a non-COVID situation, extremely important."
So taking all those things that we’ve learned and applying them to how a commercial HVAC would be just very exciting.
"And then if you’re condensing water, like one of our goals is to have it be a water source."
"If you have water, you possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well."
And it could be a hell of a product.
So we just have to… At Tesla we have a real tendency to bite off more than we can chew on the car front.
"So we’ve got to make sure… We have a lot of irons in the fire here for new products like the Cybertrucks, Semi, new Roadster, and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world, and this brilliant Model Y, and Autopilot, and the solar roof and-"
"Yeah, exactly."
"Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack."
We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage.
"More than we can supply, at least for 2020."
[inaudible 00:02:35].
"Well, we haven’t really thought about that yet."
"So it’s not out of the question, but our brain is full."
"Excuse me, sir, our brain is full."
I saw the question.
Our overarching goal is to help accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.
"And the three elements of that are sustainable power generation, then you’ve got to store the power, stationary storage, and then you’ve got to have electric transportation."
But we don’t have like specific market share goals or anything like that.
"It’s just to the degree that we can accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, we think that’s a fundamental good for the world and we want to do that as fast as possible."
"But it’s not, like I said, market share growth as a goal in and of itself."
"It’s just the faster this happens, the better off the world is."
Exactly.
"I mean, it really is… Yeah, exactly."
It’s crazy.
Yes.
"Yeah, yeah."
"I should say, we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area and that should be identified as a serious risk."
We only have two car factories right now.
One in Shanghai and one in the Bay Area.
And the Bay Area produces the vast majority of our cars.
All of S and X and most of the 3 and all of the Y.
"So the extension of the shelter-in-place, or, frankly, I would call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights, but that’s my opinion."
And erasing people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came to America or built this country.
What the fuck?
Excuse me.
"People… The outrage, it’s just an outrage."
"But it will cause great harm, not just to Tesla, but to many companies."
"And while Tesla will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not."
Everything people have worked for their whole life is being destroyed in real time.
"And we’re going to have many suppliers and are having many suppliers that are having super hard times, especially the small ones."
And it’s just causing a lot of strife to a lot of people.
Yeah.
I think it’s high time we invested in infrastructure in this country.
We have a lot of crumbling highways and bridges.
"And frankly, when I visit China I see their infrastructure as being much better than ours; it’s great."
Europe has better infrastructure.
"It’s really quite sad that the US infrastructure, especially sort of roads and highways, is where it is today."
And our airports in a lot of cases are an embarrassment.
"And it’s not just a question of money, it’s a question of will."
"And as soon as we spend a lot of money on these things, but what do we gain for it?"
"And yeah, we really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future and not the transportation for the past."
"If this was 1920, do you want to be investing in steam engines or internal combustion engines?"
Obviously not steam engines.
"So this is a time to think about the future and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people’s rights?"
As what is happening right now?
I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry.
"It’s just like, if somebody wants to stay in their house, that’s great."
They should be allowed to stay in their house and they should not be compelled to leave.
"But to say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist."
This is not democratic.
This is not freedom.
Give people back their goddamn freedom.
Zach?
"Yeah, it’s good."
It will take cost out of the car and make the product better.
"So, it’s not make the part worse."
"Any fool can take cost out of a car, make it worse."
"We want to take cost out of the car, figure out how to make it lighter and simpler."
"And so, it’s we want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering cost."
"But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect the marginal cost of that car to be comparable to the Model 3 once we have reached say [pap 00:42:42] to 10 or 20,000 units or something like that."
And have gone-
"Oh, I think… Well, we all need a Hiro."
"But obviously he brings a tremendous amount of experience investing at the highest levels in the world and has done incredible work at the Japan pension fund, which is the largest funder of any kind in the world."
And-
Of any kind in the world.
"And generally the conversations over the years, he’s just shown an incredible insight into how the securities or the global security markets work and what he thinks is where the areas for reform."
He just looks like to have a strong philosophical underpinning about how to make the future better.
"And shares that view regarding the environment, and just a very sensible, smart person who brings a lot to the board and I think is generally recognized as such by many people."
"No, I think this is [inaudible 00:46:07] with the Panasonic relationship."
I mean I have a great relationship with Panasonic CEO.
We meet regularly one-on-one and talk all the time and so that relationship is strong.
He would bring more of a broader and a global strategic view to the board.
"Well, it’s pretty much going to play out as it has played out, which is will release more and more functionality."
"Before we release any functionality, it goes through extensive testing and of course we ramp up a simulations team that has a very good simulation of the real world."
So we run any code changes through a battery of tests in simulation.
"Then we have a global QA team, which I’m on actually."
"I’m on the global QA team, and we test the releases in the real world, real world play out, the differences between the real world and the simulation which are very many because the world is very complex."
"And then we release it to a small group of private beta testers within the company, then to a larger beta audience including people outside the company, then to early access Tesla owners and then finally a broader release."
And so there are many stages that these things go through.
"So by the time something is going to wide release into the US, it has gone through all of those stages, and the software that’s at the very early stage is much more vast than what people are seeing."
So there’s just got to go through a very rigorous safety process.
"So essentially we need to figure out is if they’re very good at complex intersections, they’re very good at complex turns in intersections, and things like busy malls in a parking lot, or office park or special events and sporting events, that kind of thing, when those eventually come back."
"But yeah, those are extra hard cases but it’s all tracking very well."
"I feel like the auto pilot engineering team is, we just have an extremely talented group and I’m deeply involved with the team."
"So we talk every week and meet every week when we can, [inaudible 00:49:44] physical meetings difficult."
"So I have quite a deep understanding of where we are, where we’re headed, and I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum and we’ll have the functionality [inaudible 00:50:00], full self driving, by the end of the year."
"Then after that functionality is released, there’s still another step which is to improve the reliability of it."
"Once it’s released to kind of full self driving with humans supervision, supervised by the driver."
"And then we keep improving the reliability to the point where it no longer needs to be supervised by the driver and we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this was the case, and then presumably the regulators, depending on which jurisdiction it is, would give approval for fully autonomous cars that can drive with no human on board."
"Obviously the regulatory approval process, that’s difficult for us to predict with accuracy because it’s out of our hands, but for the rest of it, I feel very good about where we are."
[crosstalk 00:51:03].
Do you mean like when can the car drive with no person?
"If described as a hope, I would say that’s probably a fair description."
"I think it’s quite likely in my view, [Danek 00:52:10] would say-"
"I think it’s quite likely, in my view, Danek would say I could be wrong, as you’ve seen [inaudible 00:52:38] we are ahead in some areas and we’re behind in others."
"Because when I give a guess, I give the guess that I think is the likely mid point, not the point with lots of margin."
"If this is normal distribution, I’d give you the 50th percentile, not the [inaudible 00:08:02], optimistic or pessimistic."
So then that really means at least half my predictions will be wrong and half will be right.
"Or might be right but offset by a few weeks to a few months, in some cases a few years."
"But I believe everything I’ve ever said would come true, did come true."
"It may come true late, but it did come true."
"So punctuality is not my strong suit, but I always come through in the end."
So I think we could see robo taxis in operation with network fleet next year.
"Not in your market, but it’s been in some."
"Thanks, Martin."
Q4 was another strong quarter for the company.
"Deliveries reached over 112,000 vehicles in a single quarter."
It’s hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with zero advertising spend.
"We do say that from time to time, and I think it’s often overlooked, but to have the highest demand electric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is, I think, quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without a bunch of advertising."
"At our Fremont factory, we were producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record year of 2006."
And obviously we expect to exceed that significantly this year.
This greater production was achieved before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont.
So there’s a lot of potential to go beyond that number.
"Well, the Shanghai factory, I’d like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching Model 3 last quarter and achieving their first deliveries earlier this year."
I’m really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory.
I think it’s going to be an incredible asset to the company.
And we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai.
So a lot of good progress there.
"Regarding Model Y, it was only 10 months ago that we revealed the Model Y prototype, and now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already."
This was thanks to a great effort of our engineering team.
"And we managed to achieve by far the highest energy efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced, at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y all-wheel drive got an EPA rating of 315 miles."
This improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.
This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin.
"And just with great acceleration and top speed, it’s really just incredible specs all around."
"For the Cybertruck, a few months ago we revealed the Cybertruck."
"That went viral, and we’ve tried to build a product that is superior in every way without any preconceptions of how such a product should look."
"So it really just, from the standpoint of what’s the most bad ass futuristic armored personnel carrier that kicks ass of any pickup truck, basically that’s the goal."
And we wanted it to look like something that just kind of came out of a sci-fi movie set from the future.
And the demand has been incredible.
"I’ve never seen actually such a level of demand at this… we’ve never seen anything like it, basically."
I think we’ll make about as many as we can sell for many years.
We’ll sell as many as we can make.
It’s going to be pretty nuts.
And I think actually the product is better than people realize even.
They don’t even have enough information to realize just the awesomeness of it.
It’s just great.
"And then stepping back, in 2018, from a financial standpoint, where free cashflow rate the breakeven."
"But in 2019, we managed to generate more than a billion dollars of free cashflow while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y in production."
"So I think, first, to have this level of free cashflow while making massive investments in capacity, while developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the incredible performance of the Tesla team."
And I’m just so proud to work with such a great team.
"I’d like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control, and that’s what has allowed us to get to these compelling financial numbers while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace."
"In conclusion, when I think of what we have in front of us the next couple of years, we’ve got Model Y. We’ve got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass roof, Cybertruck, some very exciting improvements in battery technology, full self-driving."
We’ve got the next-gen Roadster and a bunch of other products we’ll come up with [inaudible 00:06:30] as well at the same time growing company at an incredible pace.
"In conclusion, when I think of what we have in front of us the next couple of years, we’ve got Model Y. We’ve got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass roof, Cybertruck, some very exciting improvements in battery technology, full self-driving."
We’ve got the next-gen Roadster and a bunch of other projects we’ll come up with too.
It’s hard to think of another company that has a more exciting product and technology roadmap.
So super fired up about where Tesla will be in the next 10 years.
"If you look back 10 years from today to 2010, we will produce approximately 1,000 times more cars in 2020 than we produced in 2010, 1,000."
"And we have also Solarglass and Solar Retrofit and Powerwall, Powerpack, all those other things too."
So where will we be in 10 years?
Very exciting to consider the prospect.
"We are seeing, admittedly from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for the Solarglass roof."
"So it’s difficult to predict what that will be this year, except that the demand is very strong."
"And we are working also, not just through Tesla installers, but also through new home builders and through just the roofing industry in general, where there’s in North America on the order of four million new roofs per year."
So we see a lot of interest.
"So it’s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the installation."
"But over time, I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to use Solarglass in one form or another."
It’s really going to be a choice of do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
"I think people will want a live roof that generates power and looks good and lasts a long time, and it’s the future we want."
"So it will be a significant product, but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product, and there’s a lot of challenges to overcome."
"But they will be overcome, and this will be a major product line of Tesla."
And the Buffalo factory is doing great.
"Sorry, that sounds like more question than one."
"Well, I think it probably will make sense to enable car-sharing in advance of the giant robotaxi fleet because the car-sharing can be done before a full self- driving is approved by regulators."
So it’s probably something that we would enable before the full robotaxi is enabled.
And it sounded like there were some other questions bundled in there.
"Oh, sure."
"Yeah, probably will have Superchargers in airports."
Will have Superchargers wherever we see that there is a need for Superchargers.
"Yeah, I mean, go ahead, Zach."
"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
There will be.
Right.
But I think it would make sense for us to close the loop on higher use of autopilot fully reduces the insurance cost.
It lowers the probability of injury.
"So I think insurance is going to be, I think, quite a major product of Tesla over time."
The amount of money that people spend on car insurance is a remarkably big percentage of the cost of a car.
"You can lease a Model 3 right now for $400 a month, but a typical owner in California will be paying somewhere between 100 and $200 a month in insurance."
So we’re talking about something which is maybe a quarter to half of the cost of the lease of the car is insurance.
And a lot of that insurance cost is just because the insurance companies don’t have good information about the drivers.
"And that there’s no good way to provide feedback where… it’s a very poor feedback mechanism, not in terms of insurance rates versus the actual way that the car is being driven."
Whereas we can do that in real time.
It’s a fundamental information advantage that insurance companies don’t have.
"Well, I mean, to be precise, I said I was hoping we would be complete with FSD by the end of last year."
We got pretty close.
It’s looking like we might be feature complete in a few months.
Feature complete just means it has some chance of going from your home to work with no interventions.
So it doesn’t mean the features are working well.
It means it has above zero chance.
I think that’s looking like maybe it’s going to be a couple months from now.
And what isn’t obvious regarding autopilot and full self-driving is just how much work has been going into improving the foundational elements of autonomy.
"The core autopilots and Tesla autopilot software and AI team just is, I think, very strong and making great progress."
… very strong and making great progress.
"We’re really only beginning to take full advantage of the autopilot hardware, the FSD hardware."
"I think the apparent progress as seen by consumers will seem to be extremely rapid, but actually what’s really gone over my head it seems, like I said, is just having the foundational software be very strong, having a really strong foundation."
Then a really fundamental thing is moving to video training.
"In terms of labeling, labeling with video and all eight cameras simultaneously, this is a really, I mean in terms of labeling efficiency, arguably like a three order of magnitude improvement in labeling efficiency."
"For those who know about this, it’s extremely fundamental."
We’re making great progress on that.
"Well, I guess we don’t have to."
I do think that a lot of the retail investors actually have deeper and more accurate insights than many of the big institutional investors and so may have better insights than many of the analysts.
"It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investor analysts and what some of the smaller retail investors predicted about the future of Tesla, you would probably get the highest accuracy and remarkable insight from some of those predictions."
"Sorry, go ahead."
Go ahead.
Yeah.
"I think there’s a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially the affordable cars, the 3 and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are."
"It kind of makes sense, but what we’re doing or what happened during the past was really pretty silly in making cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe."
"This created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars so you’ve got a lot of finished goods sitting on the water or waiting at the port or going through customs."
"You’ve got tariffs, transport."
"Then the factory complexity in California is very high because you’ve got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe, sort of three different types of cars that are being built."
It’s very complex.
"Just having a factory in China, a factory in North America, a factory in Europe, just that alone is a massive improvement in our fundamental operating efficiency that I think may not be fully appreciated."
"Well, we’re actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly."
"If there’s any sensible way to spend money, we are spending it."
There’s no artificial hold back on expenditures.
"Anything that I see that looks like it’s got good value for money, the answer is yes immediately."
"We’re spending money, I think, efficiently and we’re not artificially limiting our progress."
"Then despite all that, we are still generating positive cash."
"In light of that, it doesn’t make sense to raise money because we expect to [inaudible 00:26:52]."
Right.
Yeah.
Sure.
"Well, actually the core chemistry inside the 18650 cell has improved many times over the years."
It’s really just a form factor as opposed to a core technology.
I think we’re pretty happy with the energy content of the cell and the improvements in efficiency of the vehicle.
"We’re rapidly approaching a 400 mile range for the Model S, for example."
It won’t be long before Model S has a 400 mile range.
"Drew, is there anything you want to add?"
Yeah.
"Actually, the Model S and X actually have more range than we are currently stating on the website."
"We just haven’t gotten around to updating I guess, the EPA sort of [crosstalk 00:31:10] number, but the actual range of the Model S and X are above what the website says they are."
Huh?
"Yeah, the existing cars that are being made."
"Yeah, it must be somewhere in the 380s or something like that."
"[inaudible 00:31:35], yeah."
"Well, it’s certainly something that could be happening in coming years."
There’s no plans for it this year.
"The focus of Starlink is really for high bandwidth, low latency connectivity for homes and businesses and I guess aircraft and boats and that kind of thing, but the antenna for that high bandwidth, low latency thing is sort of about the size of medium pizza, which you could put on a car, but I think is more bandwidth than you would really need."
"I mean, technically, you could buy one and just stick it on the car."
"Yeah, it’ll work."
I think it’s a great antenna.
"Well, I think actually it’s most possible we’ll just use the cellular connectivity, just use 5G would be the recommendation, certainly in like any cities or something like that, but if you’re out in the countryside and there’s not good cell connectivity, then maybe you could connect with the Starlink antenna."
You don’t need to like have like gigabit level connectivity.
"Probably like 20, 30 megabits is probably fine and then you can have a much smaller antenna."
"Yeah, I guess it could be good for making sure there’s connectivity outside of major cities and that kind of thing, but I mean, that’s sort of, I’d say, relatively obtuse."
"I’m not thinking about it very much, to be honest."
"I don’t think we want to say what our CapEx is going to be this year, not necessarily, except to say like, as I said earlier, we’re spending money as fast as we can spend money in sensible ways."
It’s definitely not artificially limited.
"We will spend a lot of money this year, for sure."
"The challenge comes in like finding efficient ways to actually deploy the capital, but that’s the harder part than sort of deciding on a CapEx number really."
"Yes, exactly."
Yes.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I think that there’s so much [inaudible 00:35:52] that the core technology is improving radically that maybe you wouldn’t necessarily notice as an end customer, or some of them where you’d notice, some of them you wouldn’t, but it’s just there are these things that have a big effect on the efficiency of the company, like our total applications team that kind of builds the Tesla internal operating system and approves the sort of core automation of the company."
"That makes a big difference to our productivity, but you wouldn’t necessarily … You would see it effectively in healthier financials, but you wouldn’t necessarily notice it as like an end customer."
"[inaudible 00:37:17] for more than 30% percent, yeah."
"Yeah, I think a few years ago I said I … Yeah, I don’t know when it was, but years ago I just said my estimate is that Tesla would grow at an average rate of in excess of 50%."
My soul holds that belief.
"Yeah, I think we don’t comment on those detailed numbers, except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make in the space of, I don’t know, three or four years, something like that."
"The thing we’re going to be really focused on is increasing the battery production capacity, because that’s very fundamental, because if you don’t improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting [inaudible 00:39:19] from one part to another, and you haven’t actually produced more electric vehicles."
"That’s probably the reason why we have not, for example, really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells."
"Unless we’ve got a lot of battery cells available, then say like accelerating production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making fewer Model 3 or Model Y cars."
We’ve got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in that battery production and continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour for the batteries.
This is very-
Cost per kilowatt-hour for the batteries.
This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
"So there we’re going to do kind of a battery day, just to kind of explain more about this and what our plans are."
"I think, probably, it’s going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter because I think this is going to be kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter."
"So you know, tentatively, sort of in the April timeframe, what we’ll do is do a battery day and kind of go through what the challenges are, you know?"
"How do you get from here to, I don’t know, a couple thousand gigawatt hours a year or something."
Yeah.
"Going back to what I just said, we’ve got to improve the total battery capacity."
"Otherwise, we add complexity, but we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road."
Will we do some sort of high capacity vehicle at some point?
"Probably, but we need to make sure we’ve got the batteries to make cars that we’ve already got, already on our plate."
"And it’s just generally true… I’ve seen some sensible comments by our ARK Invest, pointing out that, really, people do prefer to drive in their cars mostly by themselves."
"I mean, the average number of occupants in a car, I think, is like 1.2?"
"Maybe with autonomy, maybe it’ll go to 1.4."
"Maybe, but I’m not sure if it even goes there."
So will it make sense for us to do sort of a minivan or sort of Sprinter-like van at some point?
"Probably, but, like I said, we’ve got to solve this battery… We’ve got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even fathom today."
That’s the real problem.
"We’re not quite sure what’s going to happen, but it is true that the instruction Model X actually increased Model S sales, because people would come in, they’d look at the Model X, and they’re like, ” Okay, I’d prefer the sedan.” And we’re worried that X sales would cause S sales to drop."
They actually closed the increase.
"So from my standpoint, I… We’re not too worried about demand, we’re worried about production."
"Just make sure we get that production ramp going, and reach volume production as soon as possible with the Model Y."
"And talk to the… [inaudible 00:43:58] predict what that… The exponential part of the S-curve of production, the production pretty much always follows this S-curve, or it’s kind of a herky-jerky S-curve."
"And you can use it to predict what it’s going to be like in the beginning because it’s slow, and it’s used to predict what it’s going to be like at the end."
"But that intermediate portion, the S-curve is very difficult to predict."
So that involves a massive amount of hard work and just reacting fast to issues that arise.
"Yeah, I think we’re just going to go as fast as we can with the Model Y and make sure it’s a great product."
"I think there are some things that will differentiate it, but that’s not something we’re going to talk about in this call."
"I think when people do a tear down of the Model Y, I think they’ll be impressed about some of the things they see."
"Yeah, I mean we’re trying to make the cars as affordable as possible, as fast as possible, while maintaining reasonable… While still being at least a little bit profitable, and growing the company like crazy and having good free cash flow and accumulating a cash balance."
Anything you want to…
"Yeah, I mean, the thing that’s really going to, probably just have a profound effect on our financials, is I guess high volume and high margin, obviously."
And that high margin part comes from autonomy.
"So do people buy the full self-driving package or not, and do they buy it worldwide or only in certain places?"
"For example, our autonomy is not as good in China as it is in the U.S., so fewer people, or a very small percentage of people, buy the FSD package in China."
"But as we fix that, then we’ll see a much higher percentage of people buying it."
"And as we get closer to full self-driving, that’s just going to become more and more compelling."
"So that’s, from a financial standpoint, that’s the real mind blowing situation is high volume, high margin, because of autonomy."
"Well, our powertrain is pretty damn good."
I mean it’s way better than anything else out there by a country mile.
"It’s worth noting, for example, that the Model S has a 100-kilowatt-hour pack."
"The Taycan has a what, like 95-kilowatt-hour pack."
The Model S is steadily approaching 400 miles of range.
The Taycan has 200 miles of range.
"So we must be using that energy pretty efficiently, and the powertrain is a big part of that."
Upside?
"Powertrain is mind blowing, I think."
Yeah.
"Coming out later this year, end of the year probably, that’s our goal."
"Get the powertrain out, end of the year, and then it’s going to be like, “This is like alien technology.” It’s insane."
"I didn’t even think we could do… Yeah, I mean honestly I thought it was no way."
But it’s kick ass.
It’s engineering team.
Just tells a little about hardcore engineering.
"[crosstalk 00:50:11] Yeah, but we don’t really ever comment on prices and stuff."
I think we’ll adjust according to what the demand looks like.
"I mean, right now, it looks pretty good."
"Maybe that’ll change, who knows?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I mean, the affordability of our car in China improved radically because of tariffs mostly going away, which is tax exemption, local parts supply."
Not having to spend a bunch of money to transport it over the ocean.
So the affordability was night and day for our car in China.
All right.
"If you know of any acquisitions, we’d love to hear about them."
"Yeah, sure."
Sounds great.
Who should we acquire?
We’re not aware of anyone that we’d want to acquire.
Letting the company to pay down debt doesn’t sound like a wise move.
Yeah.
"We’re going to pay down the debt, just as time goes by, and we paid down half a billion dollars worth of debt last quarter."
"So we’ll just keep steadily paying it down, and yeah."
So…
"But yeah, I don’t think we have anything more to say on that front, really."
"Well, I guess a lot of people sort of made fun of us for not being able to grow both cars and both capacity and it’s like now it turns out actually even the pros have trouble with it."
"You know, it’s pretty hard."
"So you know, but the fact is we’ve already demonstrated massive growth and cell production capacity at our Gigafactory in Nevada, and you have to go from the cells to the modules to the pack."
So they’ve started at cell capacity but also module and impact capacity.
"So we’ve just gotten pretty good at that, and it worked well with [inaudible 00:55:03] like Panasonic how’s our relationship has been, it’s been excellent."
They’ve been a great partner with us for many years.
We’ve added some additional partners at a smaller scale.
"We are with LG and CATL, and I will have more to talk about the Sindh detail on the battery day."
"Like I said, probably April."
We’ve got a very compelling strategy.
"I mean, we are super deep on cell, and cell through battery."
So.
So module battery.
[inaudible 00:55:40] anything you want to add to that?
We are super deep.
Rabbit holes.
"That rabbit hole goes down pretty far seven days a week working out its own days, weekend after production."
"Man, do we know a lot about batteries."
Geez.
"Yeah, absolutely."
"And how to manage those, the cell and the module and the battery and through different weather conditions and different environmental and different charge regimes and wow, we really know a lot about batteries."
Yeah.
The next level.
"Well, like I said, we’re going to talk about this on battery day, which is probably April, and then a lot of these questions will be answered."
I think it’s going to be a very compelling story that we have to present.
I think it’s going to actually blow people’s minds.
"It blows my mind and, you know, I know it."
So it’s going to be pretty cool.
It’s an important piece of the puzzle.
Yes.
"I think some of this, those sort of retail investors have managed to put together several pieces of the puzzle."
They seem to have the most insight.
"All right, you’re welcome."
" Tesla, yeah."
"By the way, I think your costume is great."
Using Twitter without a filter
What’s Twitter?
What’s going on?
"Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter."
I find it entertaining.
"I think, “Oh, other people might find this entertaining.” Sometimes they do."
Yeah.
It’s pretty random.
Yeah.
Mostly at home.
I spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think.
It’s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something.
Yeah.
"It’s pretty interesting what my most ... What people are most interested in, like some little tweet about “I love anime.” That was it."
"But it was lowercase “i”, black heart, “anime,” and people loved that."
That was like one of my most popular tweets.
Not really.
"Under the recent settlement, you don’t have to be careful about what you tweet?"
"If it’s anime, that’s one thing."
Mm-hmm.
"No, I think it’s mostly just if it’s something that might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours."
That’s about it.
"Without somebody getting mad, no."
"I look at it as a way to learn things, kinda stay in touch with what’s happening."
It feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society.
That’s what it feels like.
It’s kinda weird.
"I guess I sometimes use Twitter to express myself, and that’s a weird thing to do, I suppose."
Some people use their hair to express themselves; I use Twitter.
What did I say?
It was?
Oh.
I was just ...
I forgot which one it was.
Can you remind me?
Picking fights with the press
"Well, I have to say, my regard for the press has dropped quite dramatically."
The amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable.
"Take that Wall Street Journal front-page article about like, “The FBI is closing in.” That is utterly false."
That’s absurd.
To print such a falsehood on the front page of a major newspaper is outrageous.
"Like, why are they even journalists?"
They’re terrible.
Terrible people.
"The answer is for the press to be honest and truthful, and research their articles and correct things properly when they are false."
Which they don’t do.
"Yes, of course I do."
I suggest the press take it to heart and do better.
No.
Yeah.
"There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it’s gonna get."
"Then somebody is not a journalist, they are an ad salesman."
"Not a journalist, an ad salesman."
No.
Of course not.
Count how many negative articles there are and how many I respond to.
"One percent, maybe."
"But the common rebuttal of journalists is, “Oh."
My article’s fine.
"He’s just thin-skinned.” No, your article is false and you don’t want to admit it."
How do you think rockets get to orbit?
Not easily.
Physics is very demanding.
"If you get it wrong, the rocket will blow up."
Cars are very demanding.
"If you get it wrong, a car won’t work."
Truth in engineering and science is extremely important.
I have a strong interest in the truth.
Much more than journalists do.
"No, I wouldn’t say that."
I think they’re great.
"No, not all of them."
The “excruciating” year of 2018
It’s been a very difficult year.
"We had the Model 3 production ramp, which was excruciatingly difficult."
It is incredibly difficult to survive as a car company.
Incredibly difficult.
"People have no idea how much pain people at Tesla went through, including myself."
It was excruciating.
Excruciating.
Pretty sure I burnt out a bunch of neurons during this process.
Running both SpaceX and Tesla is an incredibly difficult ... You realize we’re fighting the incredibly competitive car companies.
They make very good cars.
They’ve been doing this for a long time.
They are entrenched.
"Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Lexus, you name it."
All those car brands.
And the history of car companies in America is terrible.
The only ones that haven’t gone bankrupt are Tesla and Ford.
That’s it.
Everyone else has gone bankrupt.
Yes.
It’s trivial to start a car company.
It is insanely difficult to make it successful.
It sounds like you’re not hearing me.
You’re definitely not understanding me.
Making a car company successful is monumentally difficult.
"There have been many attempts to create a car company and they have all failed, even the ones that have had a strong base of customers, thousands of dealers, thousands of service centers, they’ve already spent the capital for the factories, like GM and Chrysler, still went bankrupt in the last recession."
Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession.
There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession.
"So, as a startup, a car company, it is far more difficult to be successful than if you’re an established, entrenched brand."
It is absurd that Tesla is alive.
Absurd!
Absurd.
Excruciating effort.
Hundred-hour weeks by everyone.
Yes.
There wasn’t some other way to do this.
"There wasn’t some other way to do this, Kara."
Why does Musk push himself so hard?
"Well, the other option would have been, Tesla dies."
Yeah.
Tesla cannot die.
Tesla is incredibly important for the future of sustainable transport and energy generation.
"The fundamental purpose, the fundamental good that Tesla provides is accelerating the advent of sustainable transport and energy production."
Yes.
"The success of Tesla is, by far, the biggest forcing function for the other car makers to get into —"
Yeah.
Into electric cars.
They’ve said so.
Yes.
It’s very important for the future of the world.
It’s very important for all life on Earth.
"This supersedes political parties, race, creed, religion, it doesn’t matter."
"If we do not solve the environment, we’re all damned."
Yes.
"It sort of blows my mind, all these social justice warriors driving around in diesel cars."
It’s outrageous.
Do you have an electric car?
Shame on you.
Sure.
I’m shaming you into buying you an electric car.
I’m really car-shaming you.
Driving something.
"No, I think the electrification of transport, and there’s also an important part of Tesla which is solar and stationary batteries, because you need to generate electricity in a standard, sustainable way with solar and then store it at night when the sun goes down with batteries, and then use that energy from the sun to power cars."
"Without Tesla, this would still happen."
"There would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer."
"History will judge this, obviously, but I would say on the order of 10 years, maybe 20 years."
Yes.
"I think it’s probably fair to say that Tesla has advanced sustainable energy by at least five years, conservatively, and maybe closer to 10, and then if we continue to make progress, we might advance it by 20 years."
This could be all the difference in the world.
The toll on Musk and Tesla’s employees
It’s been terrible.
"This year felt like five years of aging, frankly."
The worst year of my entire career.
Insanely painful.
"For this past year, it’s been because of the Model 3 production ramp."
"Myself and others at Tesla, we had to go in and fix the mistakes in the Model 3 production system, and there were a lot of them."
I personally solved a bunch.
Jerome [Guillen] solved a bunch.
"Everyone helped, the entire team."
"Javier [Verdura], Franz [von Holzhausen], Deepak [Ahuja], everyone."
"It was ... like, we had the legal team delivering cars in Q3."
Todd [Maron] is great.
There was a lot of people ... Everyone had to basically go hardcore to solve the ramp.
"The amount of money that you lose if you don’t solve the ramp is mind-boggling, because you get hit from both sides."
"Let’s say you’re selling software or something, you don’t —"
It would be a lot easier.
But in software you don’t have a bunch of parts.
You don’t have a supply chain.
"If you don’t sell software, you lose the revenue, but you don’t incur a massive amount of cost associated with producing the software, ’cause you just make copies pretty easily."
"But for any large, complex, manufactured item, you have an entire supply chain, and that supply chain has on the order of six months of inertia."
"You place the order for parts for the car, including if you’re all the way with like two or three or four suppliers ... We have on the order of 10,000 suppliers."
It’s a crazy number.
"We have to place the orders for how many cars we think we’re gonna build roughly six months in advance, six months before final assembly, ’cause if you go all the way down the supply chain..."
"Then if you don’t actually make those cars, you still have all the costs."
It’s like a flotilla of supertankers.
The inertia of that is incredible.
"If anything happens to stall out the production progress, and that could be any one of those 10,000 suppliers, or on the order of 10,000 internal processes, if any of those is slow or wrong or whatever, you can’t make cars."
"You only need one missing thing, and whatever the slowest, least lucky part of the production process is, that sets your rate."
Self-inflicted wounds and sleep deprivation
"Yeah, there’s no question there’s, like, self-inflicted wounds."
"In fact, my brother said, “Look, if you do a self-inflicted wound, can you at least not twist the knife afterwards?” You stabbed yourself in the leg."
You don’t really need to twist it in your leg.
Why do that?
It’s not intentional.
"Sometimes you’re just under a lot of pressure, and —"
"You’re not getting much sleep, you’re under massive pressure, and you make mistakes."
It’s totally over.
I will never make another mistake again.
Yeah.
"Things are back to a hard work schedule, but not an insane work schedule."
"I was, there were times when, some weeks ..."
I don’t know.
"I haven’t counted exactly, but I would just sort of sleep for a few hours, work, sleep for a few hours, work, seven days a week."
"Some of those days must have been 120 hours, or something nutty."
You’re gonna go a little bonkers if you work 120 hours a week.
Now we’re down to 80 or 90.
It’s pretty manageable.
Yeah.
It’s not like for fun or something.
"No, it’s just like, if you’re super-stressed, you can’t go to sleep."
"You either have a choice of, like, okay, I’ll have zero sleep and then my brain won’t work tomorrow, or you’re gonna take some kind of sleep medication to fall asleep."
"Yeah, 80 or 90 ..."
Yeah.
80 is pretty sustainable.
Yeah.
The pain level for hours increases exponentially.
It’s like nonlinear above 80.
Tesla’s first profitable quarter in two years
I think at Tesla we’re doing pretty well right now.
Tesla’s not staring death in the face.
"We’re in, I think, a pretty good position."
"We don’t want to be complacent, but it’s not ... Up until around September, we were really faced with, like, “We must solve this or we’re gonna die,” constantly."
I feel like we’re no longer in the staring-death-in-the-face situation.
"Well, you never want to get complacent, so we still need to work hard, but I think we’re over the hump."
We’re certainly over the hump on Model 3 production.
"For us, making 5,000 cars in a week for Model 3 is not a big deal."
That’s just normal.
"Now we’re working on raising to 6,000 and then 7,000 Model 3s a week, while still keeping costs under control."
"We could probably do 6,000 or more, maybe 6,500 Model 3s a week right now, but it would have to stress people out and do tons of overtime."
"Our cars are constantly being updated with new technology, so we don’t really have a model year like other car companies."
"As soon as we come up with some improvement, we just roll it into production."
Self-driving cars
Drive on Navigation?
That’s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving.
"You can enter in an address, and from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, the car will change lanes."
"It will go from one highway to the next automatically, and take off-ramp automatically."
It’s pretty wild.
It’ll overtake a slow car.
It’s basically integrating navigation with the Autopilot capability.
That’s why we call it Navigate on Autopilot or Drive on Nav.
"Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras."
"There are eight cameras: Three forward, two on each side, and one rear."
We’re running essentially eight neural nets of varying complexity.
"We’ve got to integrate the output of the neural nets into path-planning and then hook in the navigations, say, “Where do you need to go?” The big challenge has been solving a wide range of corner cases."
So if you have a —
"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line."
Sometimes tar seams look like a line.
"Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason."
"One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center."
And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection.
"Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing."
Government regulation
"Yeah, we’re not really thinking about it."
We’re assuming that there won’t be —
No.
The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver.
Eyes are basically just cameras.
All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras.
"A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away."
"There’s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras."
"Yeah, that’s hopeless."
"That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide."
I think the key thing for convincing regulators that self-driving is OK is to show billions of miles with a much better statistical significance in safety than human drivers.
"If the probability of injury is half that of the average human driver, then I think, probably, regulators will support self-driving."
But it has to be a very large population.
"The statistical population of miles has to be very big, like billions, in essentially almost every possible case."
"Again, we’re assuming that’s ... We’re assuming that nothing is done on the road side, but from a regulatory standpoint, I think it’s just gonna be who ... You know, which regulatory agency has the best appreciation of statistics."
"Actually, China’s pretty good."
I think the U.S. is pretty good.
"I hope this is a federal system, because otherwise it’s gonna get weird when you cross state borders, and then you’re in a different situation."
"Yeah, I mean especially like in, say, East Coast, you’re going from like, you know, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire."
"Like you go through like several states pretty quickly, and then you wouldn’t wanna have things be different in each state."
"Yeah, not ... Yeah."
"We certainly have a close relationship with NHTSA, especially, so like the ... You know the sort of hardcore, sort of the entity that really is the hardcore regulator of road transport is NHTSA."
NHTSA sort of —
"Yeah, they’re like the regulator of cars, really."
Tesla’s competitors
"Saudi Arabia, not SoftBank."
Yeah.
I don’t really think that much about competitors.
"I just say like, you know, how do we make our cars as good as possible?"
How do we make sure we have like the best engineering and manufacturing talent in the world?
"You know, Tesla doesn’t do any advertising, or we don’t do any paid endorsements, we don’t sort of haggle for cars or anything like that."
So we’re really reliant on the quality of product to sell.
And I think it makes sense to sort of put our budget into advancing the technology to make the best possible cars.
"So, you know that’s ... I’m not sure looking at competitors really helps."
"It’s sort of like the old adage with, you know, running, you don’t wanna ..."
"If you start looking at the other runners, it’s not good, you know."
Like you can lose races because of that.
"I mean self-driving, maybe Google, Waymo?"
I don’t think anyone is close to Tesla in terms of achieving a general solution for working on —
Yeah.
Yeah.
"You can definitely make things work like in one particular city or something like that by special-casing it, but in order to work, you know, all around the world in all these different countries where there’s, like, different road signs, different traffic behavior, there’s like every weird corner case you can imagine."
You really have to have a generalized solution.
"And best to my knowledge, no one has a good generalized solution except ... and I think no one is likely to achieve a generalized solution to self-driving before Tesla."
"I could be surprised, but..."
No.
The other car companies ...
"I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving."
"You know, I think we’ll get to full self-driving next year."
"As a generalized solution, I think."
But that’s a ... Like we’re on track to do that next year.
So I don’t know.
I don’t think anyone else is on track to do it next year.
Not that I’m ...
I think there’s ...
"I would say, unless they’re keeping it incredibly secret, which is unlikely, I don’t think any of the car companies are likely to be a serious competitor."
"In self-driving, I don’t think so."
They’re just not good at software.
And this is a software problem.
"It’s a harder problem, too, on the compute side."
But they’re also not doing anything on the compute side.
So it’s like ... You do need an advanced sort of AI computer that’s very good at doing matrix multiplication with localized memory.
So that —
"Yeah, I mean ... you need a specialized inference engine."
"Like the Tesla hardware 3 Autopilot computer, that will start rolling into production early next year, is 10 times better than the next best system out there at the same price, volume and power consumption."
And it’s really because it’s got a dedicated neural net chip.
"Which basically, it sounds complicated, but it’s really like a matrix multiplier with a local memory."
"I would say close to zero percent, probably."
This is my honest ...
This is —
This is just my ... what I think.
"I mean, I’m not ... it’s not like ..."
"I could be wrong, but this is what I think."
Why Tesla is not going private after all
"They might have sold it, I don’t know."
You know ...
"I mean, as I said earlier this year, I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward."
I don’t think so.
"We don’t need to go private, I think I .... going private would ..."
I think we could execute better if we were private.
"Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like one percent [or] less of time thinking about them —"
Less than one percent of my tweets have anything to do with short-sellers.
"Yeah, but if like one in a hundred is about short-sellers, that’s still 1 percent."
I think that’s like probably even less than that.
"But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall."
"And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars."
"You know, every mistake we make is amplified."
And this is not good.
So the ...
"You know, the thought about going private was really just saying, okay, if we’re private ..."
"Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama, but if we can avoid the distraction of ..."
"If we can avoid the brand damage of ... Let’s say we’re private, and then we went public five years from now."
Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place.
That was the approximate calculus.
"And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company’s a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot."
"Yeah, yeah."
It’s gone up.
"You know, it tends to end up being like a mood, to some degree, a mood thermometer."
"So it’s like the stock goes down, people are sad and feel undercompensated."
"And then when the stock goes up, people are exuberant, overly exuberant, and —"
"Yeah, you get distracted thinking about what you’re going to buy."
"So, like, neither of these things are great."
"When you have big moves in the stock, this just causes a distraction."
"The Tesla Semi, pickup truck and other new products"
"Yeah, I’m super-excited about the future —"
Ha-ha.
We definitely do.
"The supersonic VTOL jet, electric jet."
"No, hovercrafts are pretty straightforward."
But —
"A supersonic vertical-takeoff-and-landing electric jet would be interesting to do at some point, I think."
But my head would definitely explode if I tried to do that right now.
But I’ve been thinking about that design for nine years.
It’s great.
"I mean, I wrote down some of it, but ..."
There were like a few things —
"Yeah, I think what fires me up about Tesla is, I think we’ve got the most exciting product roadmap of any company in the world."
"We’ve got the Model Y, the compact ... midsize, more midsize SUV."
"The Tesla Semi, which is gonna be great for taking ... Because semis are in constant use and use a tremendous amount of fuel, so the Tesla Semi, I think, can have a huge effect, positive effect on —"
Nice jacket.
“Who are you wearing?”
"It’s my favorite jacket, actually."
I’ve had it for ages.
The reason it looks like ...
"It looks kind of worn-out, it’s ’cause it is."
"It’s not, like, accidentally."
It’s that’s how —
"All right, yeah."
Exactly.
"Just to recap the things that are coming out, because I think it is ..."
I think it’s literally the most exciting product lineup of any company in the world.
Certainly from a consumer standpoint.
I’ll just go through the things that are publicly announced.
"You’ve got the Model Y, which is the midsize SUV."
"You’ve got the Semi truck, which is, can be great for really heavy transport."
"It’ll be like the heaviest class of truck, of industrial truck."
We’ve got the next-generation Roadster.
Which will be the fastest sports car on every dimension.
"Fastest acceleration, fastest top speed, best handling."
The goal with the Tesla Roadster is to show that an electric car can be the best sports car on every dimension.
"I think that’s very important to kind of get rid of this, like, halo effect that gasoline cars, sports cars, have —"
"Well, like let’s say that the fastest, top-speed cars in the world are still gasoline sports cars."
So I think we ... It’s important to have an electric sports car that’s faster than the fastest gasoline sports car.
And it helps address that halo effect that gasoline sports cars have.
"So I think it’s important to do that to show that, you know, electric is the best architecture."
"Then we’ve got the pickup truck, which  — actually, I’m personally most excited about the pickup truck."
"Well I can’t talk about the details, but it’s gonna be like a really futuristic like cyberpunk, “Blade Runner” pickup truck."
"It’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna be amazing."
This will be heart-stopping.
It stops my heart.
"It’s like, oh, it’s great."
"You know, I actually don’t know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not, but I don’t care."
"I mean I do care, eventually, you know."
"Like sure, I care."
"We wanna get gasoline, diesel pickup trucks off the road."
"But if I find, like, you know, I’m personally super-excited by this pickup truck."
It’s something I’ve been wanting to make for a long time.
And I’ve been iterating sort of designs with Franz ... It’s like I really wanted something that’s like super-futuristic cyberpunk.
"Which, if it doesn’t ... if I’m weirdly like ... if there’s only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we’ll make a more conventional truck in the future."
But it’s the thing that I am personally most fired up about.
It’s gonna have a lot of titanium.
"There’s like, you’ll see."
It’s like ...
"No, it’s gonna be ... Like, I think this is the kinda thing the consumer would want to buy, even if they don’t normally buy a pickup truck."
"So, anyway, that’s personally I’m most excited about."
"But like I said, it could be just like, okay, I weirdly like it and other people don’t."
That’s possible.
"But we’re gonna make it anyway, and then we will just have a niche audience, I don’t know."
"But if it does, then we’ll make a more conventional pickup truck."
No.
I rode motorbikes a lot when I was a kid.
"So I did, like, dirt biking and then rode a motorcycle on the road."
"And then I almost got killed when I was 17, so ..."
Yeah.
"So it’s like I ... You know, most people are paralyzed, but depending on how you count it, the probability of death in a motorcycle versus —"
It’s 25 times higher.
Yeah.
Like organ donors.
"Yeah, so, the thing is, I rode dirt bikes for six years or more, and did all sorts of crazy jumps and things in the dirt bike, but never got seriously injured."
And then —
"Yeah, then I almost got killed ..."
A truck knocked ...
I got hit by a truck.
Literally got hit by a truck.
"So, we’re not gonna make motorcycles."
But a few more Tesla products that are cool: We’re almost done with the development of the solar tile roof.
So we have those on a few hundred roofs right now.
And we’re just doing testing to make sure they have long-term durability.
"Yeah, the solar tile roof where it looks like a normal, beautiful tile roof."
But it’s actually solar.
"And, like, that development process is longer than we’d like, because we’ve got to make sure that the roof’s gonna stand up for 30 years."
"And even when you do accelerated lab testing on a solar roof, it still takes a while."
"And we’ve gotta put a lot of work into making the installation process easy, so it doesn’t take ages to install a roof."
Yeah.
"Long-term, there won’t be any government subsidies."
Those are just kind of like short-term things.
Oh cool.
Great.
Thank you.
Good.
Yeah.
"I mean you probably have the retrofit solar, like that’s on top of a normal roof."
So we have that.
We’ve like kind of a regular —
This is integrated with the roof.
"So the solar tile roof, where it’s integrated with the roof."
You don’t even realize it’s solar.
"And of course we have the conventional retrofit solar, so we are working on, you know, steadily improving the aesthetics of the retrofit solar."
Then we’ve got the Powerwall battery storage system.
"We’ve got the Powerpack, which is used for utilities on industrial scale."
We’re gonna have some other exciting announcements on the stationary storage front.
So when you —
"I can’t talk more about it, but there’s —"
We have a large product on the stationary storage side that I think will be very compelling for utility customers.
No plans to make planes at Tesla.
SpaceX and dying on Mars
"Well, it’d be ironic if that had happened."
Better not ...
I think we just be careful ...
"I have to be careful about tempting fate, because I think often the most ironic outcome is the most probable."
"Reality, yes."
It might happen.
"You know, like the ..."
"It just very often seems like reality tries to ... Actually, technically, there’s a friend of mine, Jonah Nolan, who had this like modification of Occam’s razor where he said he thinks “the most ironic outcome is the most likely.” And then I think that there’s some truth to that."
And then also I think sometimes the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.
"Whether that entertainment is in the nature of drama, comedy or something else —"
I mean hopefully me dying on impact on Mars is not the most entertaining outcome.
’Cause then what happens next?
"It’s like, okay, you’re a crater."
Yes.
"Yeah, so this year’s been great for SpaceX."
"We successfully launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, which is the most powerful rocket in the world by a factor of two."
"So that’s twice the power, twice the thrust of the next biggest rocket."
And we actually launched a Tesla — my Tesla Roadster to Mars orbit.
"And although ... Like a lot of people thought this was like some ego thing or whatever, but ..."
It’s ... I’m trying to ...
"I’m trying to listen to the reality simulation, which is do the most entertaining thing."
That’s pretty entertaining.
"And you know, we had a lot of, you know, like playing David Bowie."
"And where, like, “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” stuff in there, we’ve got the Asimov Foundation series etched in glass."
Like there’s a lot of like little things.
There might be.
I don’t know all the things that are on there.
But there’s probably some weird things in there.
"The ... like the reason we did that is actually because, normally, when a new rocket is launched, you just put a dummy payload, which is like a block of concrete or something."
"Like, literally, I think when Boeing launched the Delta IV Heavy, they launched a block of concrete or something."
Super-boring.
"So we were like, okay, what is the least boring thing we can launch?"
Yes.
Absolutely.
"So we launched Falcon Heavy, we launched the Block Five or version, sort of version five, technically version seven, of Falcon 9 this year."
"We were able to re-fly a rocket three times, which is great."
"We came close to catching the fairing with this weird ... we actually got a boat that, that’s quite a big boat, and then put this giant net over this boat and so it’s like this boat that’s a giant catcher’s mitt —"
Yeah to catch the nose cone when it’s falling back from space.
"Yeah, that’s pretty fun."
No.
No.
"We missed, unfortunately."
But we get close.
We got close.
I think it’s moored in L.A. or something.
"Yeah, yeah."
It’s a boat with a giant net.
And it sort of —
"No, I think, like, nylon or Kevlar."
"Yeah, so we were close to catching the fairing."
"And then next year, the exciting things are we’re gonna be launching astronauts for the first time to the space station."
"It’ll really be the first time a vehicle from the United States launches astronauts into orbit since the Space Shuttle, which —"
2010 or something like that?
"Yeah, yeah, so since then, the United States has relied upon the Russian Soyuz, which actually recently has had some issues."
"And that ... so for the first time, around the middle of —"
... middle of next year.
"Yeah, the ... for the first time since the Space Shuttle, a U.S. vehicle will transport U.S. astronauts to orbit."
Donald Trump’s Space Force and colonizing beyond Earth
"Well, this may be a little controversial, but I actually like the idea."
I think it’s cool.
"You know, like, when the Air Force was formed, there was a lot of like pooh-poohing, and like, “Oh, how silly to have an Air Force!” You know, because the aircraft in World War II were managed by the Army."
"And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft."
And so the Air Force was created.
"And people today may not realize back then it was wildly panned as a ridiculous thing to create the Air Force, but now everyone’s like, “Obviously you should have an Air Force.” And I think it’s gonna become obvious that we should have a Space Force, too."
"Well, I mean, I kinda think it’s ... You know, it’s basically defense in space."
"And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization ... You know, expanding things beyond Earth."
"You know, the Space Force could be something that ... Like, I think we could just have a base on the moon, for example."
A base on Mars.
Be great to expand on the idea of a Space Force.
"Like, you know, I think ... for explorers ... anyone who has an exploratory spirit, and I think that especially applies to a country like the United States, where you know it’s kind of the distillation of the spirit of human exploration."
I think the idea of being out there among the stars and among the planets is very exciting.
I don’t know ...
I haven’t had detailed conversations.
But I do think it will become obvious over time that a Space Force is a sensible thing to do.
Going to Mars
"Yeah, we’re still aiming for 2024."
I don’t know if I will go or not.
"It may be just an unmanned mission, you know."
I’m not sure if there’ll be people onboard or not.
"But there is a Mars rendezvous opportunity, ’cause you can only do a launch to Mars roughly every two years."
"So around the 2024 timeframe, there’s a rendezvous opportunity for Mars, which hopefully we can catch."
There’s one in 2022 —
"Hopefully, there are people on board."
But I think there’s a pretty good chance of at least having an unmanned craft go to Mars.
I think we will try to do this.
"Well, I suspect by the time we make enough progress to wanna try to do it, I suspect that the U.S. government will be interested in doing this, too, or being part of the effort."
"But I think ... the vehicle that we’re designing right now, which is sort of code-named BFR, I’m thinking of changing the official name to Heart of Gold."
"Well, I do like that song, but it’s more like the spaceship in “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”"
And it’s powered by infinite improbability.
I still think it’s the great ...
This is like a very great power source.
"BFR is, to some degree, a Rorschach test on acronyms."
"But officially, it is the Big Falcon Rocket."
It’s a Rorschach test.
"Yeah, I certainly think NASA should continue to exist, NASA does a lot of really useful things, and these go beyond astronaut transport."
There are missions to rovers on Mars that are thanks to NASA.
"There are these planetary probes, there’s the Hubble Telescope, there’s a ..."
"So, NASA does a tremendous amount of good, so I definitely think we should ... NASA should continue, and ideally we should actually increase the budget of NASA, and we’re really ..."
I think it’s high time that we went beyond Earth orbit again.
"I think it’s very exciting and inspiring, and I think it really gets the whole world fired up."
"It can, yeah."
"I mean, when the first humans stepped foot on the Moon, it was probably the most inspiring thing, maybe in history?"
"Yeah, it’s like, if it’s not the most inspiring ..."
I think it’s the most inspiring thing in history for Earth as a whole.
We should try to do more of that stuff.
"Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin and Amazon"
"Yeah, I think it’s great that Jeff is spending lots of money on space."
"And they are a competitor, but it’s good that he’s spending money on ... that he’s spending a lot of money on developing rockets."
"I think it will encounter some challenges getting to orbit, it’s remarkably difficult getting to orbit."
But he has the resources to overcome those difficulties.
"He seems, he’s got some spare —"
"Some spare change in the couch, I think."
"No, I don’t generally acquire things."
"I create companies, but I don’t really acquire them."
So I wouldn’t ...
I have no plans.
It does seem to be popular these days.
"Yeah, yeah, totally."
"Wait, is there something you think I should buy?"
"I mean, do you have any suggestions?"
Don’t know.
"Yeah, he does have a lot."
"Speaking of the vagaries of stock price, though, it’s like Amazon shot way up and then it went down."
"And I think Amazon is a great company and Jeff’s done some amazing things, and Amazon is obviously one of the greatest companies in the world."
"But I imagine that they experienced challenges when the stock price rises so much and then falls, and it’s —"
"Yeah, but it’s, what, dropped 30 percent or something."
"That’s quite a lot, you know?"
"The Boring Company, dad jokes and drilling technology"
"Oh, great, yeah."
Eric’s been a —
"Yeah, Eric’s been a great supporter."
"Yeah, Eric’s been really supportive of our activity in L.A."
"I mean, technically, our first tunnels are in Hawthorne."
"But we do expect to, over time, create a network of tunnels under greater L.A. And I think this is really the key to getting around the city very fast."
You’ve got to go 3-D.
"Essentially, we have a 3-D ... our offices are 3-D and dense, but we then have a 2-D road transport network, so it’s ... And everyone would just go in and out of the buildings at the same time, so, naturally, you’re going to have traffic."
It’s like —
"Yeah, many levels of tunnels, so —"
"Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional."
"You’ll have a subway cross another subway, but they’ve never really tried to make many layers of subways."
"The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive."
And they’ve also been incredibly slow.
"So, if it takes ..."
I don’t know how long.
"Say the New York Subway had a one-mile extension or something, and it cost —"
"Yeah, exactly."
"I know that L.A. has a subway, although people don’t ... most people don’t —"
Is it good?
You’re the first person I’ve met that actually uses the subway.
"Well, they had a two-mile extension, or two-and-a-half-mile extension on the subway that cost $2 billion."
"So the typical cost for a subway, per-mile cost for a subway in the U.S. has been about a billion dollars a mile, so that is not a very scalable solution."
"Yeah, so you really have to ... We have to massively improve the technology associated with digging tunnels so that —"
Being many layers.
"I mean, you could do ... you could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don’t do it."
"But you can go down 100 levels if you want to, you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other, it’s ... You can go further down than you can go up."
So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings.
"But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology."
"That’s the linchpin, that’s fundamentally what it amounts to."
"And as I got sort of digging into tunnels ... Ha-ha, good one."
"Yeah, yeah, no, I’ve got a million of ’em."
Tunnels are really so underappreciated.
They have no place to go but down.
"I am a dad, so —"
"Yeah, totally."
So —
"Yeah, no, no I definitely am amused by myself, it’s a terrible habit."
Terrible habit.
"Yes, tunnels."
"So, the —"
"No no, it’s a terrible habit, I laugh at my own jokes, even with the terrible ones."
"So, what I discovered is that there are massive improvements possible in tunneling technology, and I found ..."
"I always look at things from a fundamentals-of-physics standpoint, and so if you sort of apply physics’ first principles to any given technology endeavor, you can sort of envelop the possibilities."
And what I discovered in talking to the engineering heads of the various tunneling companies is that they actually did not know what ...
I had no idea what the true potential of tunneling was.
"’Cause the first question I’d ask is, “Well, is your tunneling machine power-limited or thermally limited?” This was a very obvious question from a physics standpoint."
Nobody knew.
None of them could answer that question.
"I was like, “Okay, this is not a good sign.” And the answer is, basically everything’s power-limited within the framework of how much you can transport heat away from the face using some sort of liquid cooling system."
"But we’re so far away from that, it’s ... We’re crazy far away from that."
"No, of being anywhere near the thermal limit."
"Things like increasing power is relatively easy, and then you hit the threshold where you’ve added so much power that you’re melting the drill head."
"So then you have to put a lot of effort into cooling the drill head in order to not melt it, or go with advanced ceramics."
But then you still have to cool the bearings and the bearing housings.
"So I’m used to a lot of this stuff from rocket engine design, for example."
"The turbopump on the Merlin engine runs at like 36,000 RPM."
"It’s got 10,000 horsepower and weighs —"
"Yeah, essentially taking rocket technology and automotive technology and applying it to drilling technology."
"We need to massively crank up the power to the drill head, and then ... then we need to cool it."
"But the first step is simply jacking up the power like crazy, and then automating the placement of the tunnel reinforcements, so that the tunnel —"
"Yeah, like right now, tunnel machines will drill for a bit and then they’ll stop, and people will put in ... very slowly put in the —"
The reinforcing segments.
And so tunneling machines basically go at half-speed.
"Well, you can make house construction crazy-fast if you’re in a factory."
"Yeah, construction in general is ..."
I think there’s a lot of potential for disruption and for entrepreneurs to enter construction in general.
There’s a tremendous amount of opportunity.
"Anyway, so massively cranking up the power of the drill, then making the drill battery-powered ... which is not something they’d ever considered."
But if you don’t make it battery-powered then you’ve got to have this massive cable —
Yeah.
"And then the cable, in order to have the cable manageable at all, has to be an 11 kVA ... 11,000 volts cable, and even then it’s thick."
And then you’ve got to have step-down transformers for the drill head-
"Because the drill head’s going to operate at 480 volts or thereabouts, it’s not going to operate at 11,000."
"So you’ve got these massive transformers, this crazy cable length, the —"
"Yeah, it’s very slow, and then this is what blew my mind."
They’re using a diesel locomotive.
"The standard practice is to use a diesel locomotive to transport the tunneling segments to the drill head and to transport the dirt out, and to use it — and a one-way."
"Yeah, it’s pretty weird."
"So, if you’ve got a diesel locomotive in a tunnel, then you’ve got to put massive effort into blowing clean air into the tunnel and getting ... ’cause you’ve got the —"
"Oh, well, we’d just use an electric car."
"Yes, we took a Model 3 chassis and converted that into a train, a Model 3-powered train chassis, and so now we have a —"
"It’s not consuming oxygen and spewing noxious fumes, this was a big improvement."
"Yeah, we’re about to finish the first test tunnel."
"I don’t know, I think it’s probably ..."
"Excluding the equipment, probably cost us $10 million for a mile."
"It’s one-way, admittedly, but —"
"We’re planning on having an opening party on Dec. 10th, in six weeks."
"Yeah, you wanna come?"
"Yeah, this’ll be a very one-dimensional party."
"Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi investors and techlash"
"Yeah, well I mean, it’s important to appreciate that the Saudis have been approaching me for two years about going private."
It wasn’t like spur-of-the-moment.
"Yeah, I mean, that sounds pretty bad."
So ... that is not good.
That is bad.
"That was really bad, it was really —"
"Sorry, are you asking about the Saudis or something else?"
Okay.
"I think we probably would not, yes."
"I know I can’t speak to that, I mean, it’s not ... Saudi Arabia’s an entire country, so I think you don’t want to, if there’s one really bad thing that occurred, nail down the whole country, it’s not great."
"They didn’t elect him, you know?"
"I think we should just consider that there is a whole country, and there’s, you know ..."
"There are a lot of good people in Saudi Arabia, and Saudis who are outside of Saudi Arabia."
So I think you cannot paint an entire country with one brush.
"I think there are serious issues, it’s not good."
"Yeah, I think there’s probably ..."
"It probably makes sense if something is responsible for a public good, and could potentially negatively affect elections or something like that, that there probably should be some regulatory oversight to ensure that we’re not negatively affecting the democratic process."
That the quality of news is good and not unduly influenced.
These seem like sensible things.
"In the long term, if it ... As AI gets probably much smarter than humans, the relative intelligence ratio is probably similar to that between a person and a cat, maybe bigger."
I do think we need to be very careful about the advancement of AI and —
"Yeah, I think ..."
"I mean, my recommendation for the longest time has been consistent."
"I think we ought to have a government committee that starts off with insight, gaining insight."
"Spends a year or two gaining insight about AI or other technologies that are maybe dangerous, but especially AI."
"And then, based on that insight, comes up with rules in consultation with industry that give the highest probability for a safe advent of AI."
I do not.
"No, to the best of my knowledge, this is not occurring."
"Yeah, OpenAI was about the democratization of AI power."
"So that’s why OpenAI was created as a nonprofit foundation, to ensure that AI power ... or to reduce the probability that AI power would be monopolized."
"There is a very strong concentration of AI power, and especially at Google/DeepMind."
"And I have very high regard for Larry Page and Demis Hassabis, but I do think that there’s value to some independent oversight."
How is Musk feeling about the future?
"I think sometimes when I mention the simulation, people infer that, “Well, therefore we shouldn’t take what appears to be reality seriously.” And I do think we should take what appears to be reality seriously, yeah."
"I said, “What appears to be reality.”"
"For some reason, I feel optimistic."
"And I’m not sure if that is irrational or not, but that is my —"
My current gut feel is weirdly optimistic.
"I don’t know, don’t know."
"Well, you were right."
Yeah.
"By the way, I still think it was worth trying on the Trump ... to be on the Trump councils, and especially just to be an advocate for climate, I did my absolute best, and it’s sort of —"
I definitely do not think I am Jesus.
"Arguably, it was unlikely, but it was worth a shot, yeah."
"Do you mean now, or ...?"
"I don’t know, are there councils?"
Yes.
"And, actually, I’m not sure if you know this but in terms of ... LGBTQIA?"
This like a very quite complicated —
"Yeah, but —"
Totally.
"I’m like, “Do I have all the letters?”"
"There’s a new letter, no there’s a new one."
"Oh no, okay."
"But there’s an independent organization that evaluates companies in terms of their ... let’s at least for now, say just LGBTQ-friendliness."
"And we’ve gotten 100 out of 100 every year for like four or five years running, so —"
"I am thinking about the midterm elections, and I did vote, by the way."
Though I do wonder what effect a vote in California has.
There’s so much gerrymandering of electoral districts that it seems like ...
"I voted for the sake of voting, but things are very divisive right now, politically."
"But it’s probably not wise for me to wade into political debates, it’s a no-win situation."
"I definitely wish people wouldn’t yell at each other quite so much, I wish there was less hate."
No.
"I mean, I think the ..."
"I feel we’re doing a lot of good here at Tesla on the climate stuff, and also making products people love."
"It’s one thing to make an electric car, but can we also make a product that people love, that really makes them happy?"
There’s not many products you can buy that really make you happier.
"And so Apple did that for a long time, I still think, obviously, that Apple makes great phones, and —"
The ones without the cable?
"Yeah, the one without the cable?"
"No, I still use an iPhone and everything."
"But Apple used to really bring out products that would blow people’s minds, you know?"
"And still make great products, but there’s less of that."
There’s less of that.
I don’t think people are necessarily running to the store for the iPhone 11.
"But I think with Tesla, we really want to make products that people just love, that are heart-stopping."
"If he got one redo on something from 2018, what would he redo?"
That was five years ago.
My back still hurts.
I would definitely not do that again.
"Forty-five minutes of sumo wrestling has caused me five years of back pain, so ..."
"I mean, it’s fair to say I would probably not have tweeted some of the things I tweeted, that was probably unwise."
And probably not gotten into some of the online fights that I got into.
"I probably shouldn’t have attacked journalists, probably shouldn’t have done that."
I’m sorry to some journalists.
"Thank you, Kara."
It was great to see you.
"Always, it was great to see you."
Why Tesla won’t make a scooter
"I mean, why not?"
"I don’t know, there was some people in the studio who wanted to make a scooter, but I was like, “Uh, no.”"
It lacks dignity.
Yes they do.
Have you tried driving one of those things?
They —
"They do not, you are laboring under an illusion."
This is an illusion.
"Electric bike, I think we might do an electric bike, yeah."
"That was a pleasure, thank you."
It was good to see you.

"Tesla, yeah."
What’s going on?
"Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter."
I find it entertaining.
"I think, “Oh, other people might find this entertaining.” Sometimes they do."
Yeah.
It’s pretty random.
Yeah.
Mostly at home.
I spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think.
It’s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something.
Yeah.
"It’s pretty interesting what my most ... What people are most interested in, like some little tweet about “I love anime.” That was it."
"But it was lowercase “i”, black heart, “anime,” and people loved that."
That was like one of my most popular tweets.
Not really.
"No, I think it’s mostly just if it’s something that might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours."
That’s about it.
"Without somebody getting mad, no."
"I look at it as a way to learn things, kinda stay in touch with what’s happening."
It feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society.
That’s what it feels like.
It’s kinda weird.
"I guess I sometimes use Twitter to express myself, and that’s a weird thing to do, I suppose."
Some people use their hair to express themselves; I use Twitter.
Oh.
The amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable.
"Take that Wall Street Journal front-page article about like, “The FBI is closing in.” That is utterly false."
That’s absurd.
To print such a falsehood on the front page of a major newspaper is outrageous.
"Like, why are they even journalists?"
They’re terrible.
"The answer is for the press to be honest and truthful, and research their articles and correct things properly when they are false."
Which they don’t do.
I suggest the press take it to heart and do better.
Yeah.
"There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it’s gonna get."
"Then somebody is not a journalist, they are an ad salesman."
"Not a journalist, an ad salesman."
No.
Of course not.
Count how many negative articles there are and how many I respond to.
"One percent, maybe."
"But the common rebuttal of journalists is, “Oh."
My article’s fine.
"He’s just thin-skinned.” No, your article is false and you don’t want to admit it."
Not easily.
Physics is very demanding.
"If you get it wrong, the rocket will blow up."
Cars are very demanding.
"If you get it wrong, a car won’t work."
Truth in engineering and science is extremely important.
I have a strong interest in the truth.
Much more than journalists do.
"No, I wouldn’t say that."
I think they’re great.
"No, not all of them."
It’s been a very difficult year.
"We had the Model 3 production ramp, which was excruciatingly difficult."
It is incredibly difficult to survive as a car company.
Incredibly difficult.
"People have no idea how much pain people at Tesla went through, including myself."
It was excruciating.
Pretty sure I burnt out a bunch of neurons during this process.
Running both SpaceX and Tesla is an incredibly difficult ... You realize we’re fighting the incredibly competitive car companies.
They make very good cars.
They’ve been doing this for a long time.
They are entrenched.
"Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Lexus, you name it."
All those car brands.
And the history of car companies in America is terrible.
The only ones that haven’t gone bankrupt are Tesla and Ford.
That’s it.
Everyone else has gone bankrupt.
It is insanely difficult to make it successful.
It sounds like you’re not hearing me.
Making a car company successful is monumentally difficult.
"There have been many attempts to create a car company and they have all failed, even the ones that have had a strong base of customers, thousands of dealers, thousands of service centers, they’ve already spent the capital for the factories, like GM and Chrysler, still went bankrupt in the last recession."
Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession.
There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession.
"So, as a startup, a car company, it is far more difficult to be successful than if you’re an established, entrenched brand."
It is absurd that Tesla is alive.
Absurd!
Absurd.
Excruciating effort.
Hundred-hour weeks by everyone.
Yes.
There wasn’t some other way to do this.
"There wasn’t some other way to do this, Kara."
"Well, the other option would have been, Tesla dies."
Yeah.
Tesla cannot die.
Tesla is incredibly important for the future of sustainable transport and energy generation.
"The fundamental purpose, the fundamental good that Tesla provides is accelerating the advent of sustainable transport and energy production."
Yeah.
Into electric cars.
They’ve said so.
Yes.
It’s very important for the future of the world.
It’s very important for all life on Earth.
"This supersedes political parties, race, creed, religion, it doesn’t matter."
"If we do not solve the environment, we’re all damned."
Sure.
I’m shaming you into buying you an electric car.
Driving something.
Yes.
"I think it’s probably fair to say that Tesla has advanced sustainable energy by at least five years, conservatively, and maybe closer to 10, and then if we continue to make progress, we might advance it by 20 years."
This could be all the difference in the world.
"For this past year, it’s been because of the Model 3 production ramp."
"Myself and others at Tesla, we had to go in and fix the mistakes in the Model 3 production system, and there were a lot of them."
I personally solved a bunch.
Jerome [Guillen] solved a bunch.
"Everyone helped, the entire team."
"Javier [Verdura], Franz [von Holzhausen], Deepak [Ahuja], everyone."
"It was ... like, we had the legal team delivering cars in Q3."
Todd [Maron] is great.
There was a lot of people ... Everyone had to basically go hardcore to solve the ramp.
It would be a lot easier.
But in software you don’t have a bunch of parts.
You don’t have a supply chain.
"If you don’t sell software, you lose the revenue, but you don’t incur a massive amount of cost associated with producing the software, ’cause you just make copies pretty easily."
"But for any large, complex, manufactured item, you have an entire supply chain, and that supply chain has on the order of six months of inertia."
"You place the order for parts for the car, including if you’re all the way with like two or three or four suppliers ... We have on the order of 10,000 suppliers."
It’s a crazy number.
"We have to place the orders for how many cars we think we’re gonna build roughly six months in advance, six months before final assembly, ’cause if you go all the way down the supply chain..."
"Then if you don’t actually make those cars, you still have all the costs."
It’s like a flotilla of supertankers.
The inertia of that is incredible.
"If anything happens to stall out the production progress, and that could be any one of those 10,000 suppliers, or on the order of 10,000 internal processes, if any of those is slow or wrong or whatever, you can’t make cars."
"You only need one missing thing, and whatever the slowest, least lucky part of the production process is, that sets your rate."
It’s not intentional.
Yeah.
It’s not like for fun or something.
"No, it’s just like, if you’re super-stressed, you can’t go to sleep."
"You either have a choice of, like, okay, I’ll have zero sleep and then my brain won’t work tomorrow, or you’re gonna take some kind of sleep medication to fall asleep."
Yeah.
80 is pretty sustainable.
Yeah.
The pain level for hours increases exponentially.
It’s like nonlinear above 80.
I think at Tesla we’re doing pretty well right now.
Tesla’s not staring death in the face.
"We’re in, I think, a pretty good position."
"We don’t want to be complacent, but it’s not ... Up until around September, we were really faced with, like, “We must solve this or we’re gonna die,” constantly."
I feel like we’re no longer in the staring-death-in-the-face situation.
"Well, you never want to get complacent, so we still need to work hard, but I think we’re over the hump."
We’re certainly over the hump on Model 3 production.
"For us, making 5,000 cars in a week for Model 3 is not a big deal."
That’s just normal.
"Now we’re working on raising to 6,000 and then 7,000 Model 3s a week, while still keeping costs under control."
"We could probably do 6,000 or more, maybe 6,500 Model 3s a week right now, but it would have to stress people out and do tons of overtime."
"Our cars are constantly being updated with new technology, so we don’t really have a model year like other car companies."
"As soon as we come up with some improvement, we just roll it into production."
"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line."
Sometimes tar seams look like a line.
"Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason."
"One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center."
And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection.
"Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing."
No.
The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver.
Eyes are basically just cameras.
All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras.
"A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away."
"There’s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras."
"Yeah, that’s hopeless."
"That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide."
I think the key thing for convincing regulators that self-driving is OK is to show billions of miles with a much better statistical significance in safety than human drivers.
"If the probability of injury is half that of the average human driver, then I think, probably, regulators will support self-driving."
But it has to be a very large population.
"The statistical population of miles has to be very big, like billions, in essentially almost every possible case."
The other car companies ...
"I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving."
"But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall."
"And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars."
"You know, every mistake we make is amplified."
And this is not good.
So the ...
It’s great.
"I mean, I wrote down some of it, but ..."
No.
I rode motorbikes a lot when I was a kid.
"So I did, like, dirt biking and then rode a motorcycle on the road."
"And then I almost got killed when I was 17, so ..."
Yeah.
Like organ donors.
"Yeah, then I almost got killed ..."
Yeah.
"I mean you probably have the retrofit solar, like that’s on top of a normal roof."
"So the solar tile roof, where it’s integrated with the roof."
You don’t even realize it’s solar.
"And of course we have the conventional retrofit solar, so we are working on, you know, steadily improving the aesthetics of the retrofit solar."
We have a large product on the stationary storage side that I think will be very compelling for utility customers.
There might be.
I don’t know all the things that are on there.
But there’s probably some weird things in there.
"The ... like the reason we did that is actually because, normally, when a new rocket is launched, you just put a dummy payload, which is like a block of concrete or something."
"Like, literally, I think when Boeing launched the Delta IV Heavy, they launched a block of concrete or something."
Yes.
Absolutely.
"So we launched Falcon Heavy, we launched the Block Five or version, sort of version five, technically version seven, of Falcon 9 this year."
"And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft."
And so the Air Force was created.
"You know, the Space Force could be something that ... Like, I think we could just have a base on the moon, for example."
A base on Mars.
Be great to expand on the idea of a Space Force.
I don’t know if I will go or not.
"It may be just an unmanned mission, you know."
I’m not sure if there’ll be people onboard or not.
