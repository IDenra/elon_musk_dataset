Welcome back.,Here we go again.
Great to see you and congratulations.,Thank you.
"You will never forget what is going on in the world when you think about when your child is born. You will know for the rest of this child’s life, you were born during a weird time.",That’s for sure.
That is for sure. Probably the weirdest that I can remember.,"Yeah. Yeah, and he was born on May the fourth."
"That’s hilarious, too.",Yeah.
May the fourth be with him.,"Yes, exactly."
It has to be.,Hopefully. I sure hope so.
Perfect.,Yes.
I mean that was the perfect day for you. How do you say the name? Is it placeholder?,"First of all, my partner is the one that actually mostly came up with the name."
Congratulations to her.,"Yeah, yeah. She’s great at names. I mean it’s just X, the letter X, and then the ae is like pronounced ash. Yeah, and then eight, 12 is my contribution."
"Oh, why are eight, 12?","Archangel 12, the precursor to the SR71. Coolest plane ever. True."
"I agree with you. I don’t know, I’m not familiar with it. I know what the SR71 is.","Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, I know what that is.",The SR71 came from a CIA program called Archangel. It’s the Archangel project.
"Oh wow, what a dope looking plane.",Yeah.
"Oh, okay. I got it.",Yeah.
"Well, as a person who’s a very much into aerial travel as you are, that’s perfect.",It’s pretty great.
Yeah. Pretty great. Does it feel strange to have a child while this craziness is going? Does it feel like you’ve had children before? Is this any weirder?,"Actually, I think it’s better being older and having a kid. I appreciate it more. Yeah, babies are awesome."
They are pretty awesome.,They’re awesome. Yeah.
"When I didn’t have any of my own, I would see other people’s kids and I didn’t not like them, but I wasn’t drawn to them. But now when I see little people’s kids, I’m like, Oh, I think of them as like these little love packages.","Yeah, little love bugs."
"Yeah. It’s just you think of them differently when you see them come out and then grow and then eventually start talking to you, like your whole idea what a baby is, is very different.",Yeah.
"Now, as you get older and get to appreciate it as a mature, fully formed adult, it must be really pretty wonderful.","Yeah. Great. Wonderful. It’s great. But babies are awesome. Yeah, it’s great. Yeah. Also, I’ve spent a lot of time on AI and neural nets and so you can sort of see the brain develop, which is … An AI neural net is trying to simulate what a brain does, basically. You can sort of see it learning very quickly. You know, it’s just wow."
"You’re talking about the neural net, you’re not talking about an actual baby.",I’m talking about an actual baby.
But both of them.,"Yes, but the word neural net comes from the brain. It’s like a net of neurons. Humans are the original gangster of the neural net."
That’s a great way to put it.,Yeah.
"When you’re programming artificial intelligence where you’re working with artificial intelligence art, are they specifically trying to mimic the developmental process of a human brain?","In a lot of ways. There’s some ways that are different. An analogy that’s often used is like we don’t make a submarine swim like a fish, but we take the principles of hydrodynamics and apply them to the submarine."
"I’ve always wondered as a lay person, do you try to achieve the same results as the human brain but through different methods? Or do you try to copy the way a human brain achieves results?","I mean, the essential elements of an AI neural net are really very similar to a human brain neural net. Yeah. It’s having the multiple layers of neurons and you know, back propagation. All these things are what your brain does. You have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition and then it’ll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place. It’s interesting. Very interesting."
"Yeah, I would imagine. The thought of programming something that is eventually going to be smarter than us that one day it’s going to be like, why did you do it that way? When artificial intelligence becomes sentient, they’re like, Oh, you tried to mimic yourself. This is so much better process. Cut out all this nonsense.","Like I said, there are elements that are the same but just like an aircraft does not fly like a bird."
Right.,"It doesn’t flap its wings, but the wings, the way the wings work and generate lift is the same as a bird."
Now you’re in the middle of this strange time where you’re selling your houses. You say you don’t want any material possessions and I’ve been seeing all that and I’ve been really excited to talk to you about this. Because it’s an interesting thing to come from a guy like yourself. Like why are you doing that?,"I’m slightly sad about it, actually."
"If you’re sad about it, why are you doing it?","I think possessions kind of weigh you down and they’re kind of an attack vector. They’ll say, “Hey, billionaire, you’ve got all this stuff.” Well, now I don’t have stuff now what are you going to do?"
Attack vector meaning like people targeted.,Yeah.
"Interesting, yeah. But you’re obviously going to, so you’re going to rent a place?",Yeah.
"Okay, and get rid of everything except clothes?","No, I said like almost everything, so it’s like …"
Keep a couple of Teslas.,"Kind of have to, to test product and stuff. You know, there’s things that have sentimental value for sure are keeping those."
Do you feel like … [crosstalk 00:06:39],"I mean, what’s the worst that could happen? I mean, you’re fine."
"Yeah, you can always buy more stuff if you don’t like it.",I suppose so.
"Yeah, I mean from the money that you sell all your stuff, you can buy new stuff. Do you feel like people define you by the fact that you’re wealthy and that they define you in a pejorative way?","For sure. I mean not everyone, but for sure in recent years billionaire has become pejorative like that’s a bad thing. Which I think doesn’t make a lot of sense in most cases. If you basically organized a company … How does this wealth arise? If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before and you have some ownership in that company then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital."
"For sure. I mean not everyone, but for sure in recent years billionaire has become pejorative like that’s a bad thing. Which I think doesn’t make a lot of sense in most cases. If you basically organized a company … How does this wealth arise? If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before and you have some ownership in that company then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital.","There’s a conflation of consumption and capital allocation. Take Warren Buffet, for example, and to be totally frank I’m not his biggest fan, but you know, he does like have full allocation and he reads a lot of annual reports of companies and all the accounting and it’s pretty boring really. He’s trying to figure out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital? I mean it’s kind of a boring job if you ask me."
"There’s a conflation of consumption and capital allocation.

He’s trying to figure out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital? I mean it’s kind of a boring job if you ask me.","It’s still a thing that’s important to figure out. Like, which is a company deserving of more or less capital. Should that company grow or expand? Is it making products and services that are better than others or worse? If a company is making compelling products and services, it should get more capital and if it’s not, it should get less or go out of business."
"Well, there’s a big difference, too, between someone who’s making an incredible amount of money designing and engineering fantastic products versus someone who’s making an incredible amount of money by investing in companies or moving money around in the stock market or doing things along those lines. It’s a different thing and to put them all in the same category seems, it’s very simple. As you pointed out, it’s an attack vector.","Yeah, for sure. I think it’s really, I do think there, in the United States especially, there’s an over allocation of talent in finance and law. Basically, too many smart people go into finance and law. This is both a compliment and a criticism. We should have, I think, fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff."
Yeah.,Yeah.
Well that would certainly be better for all involved if they made better stuff.,"Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Manufacturing used to be highly valued in the United States and these days it’s not. It’s often looked down upon, which I think is wrong."
"Yeah. Well, I think that people are kind of learning that particularly because of this whole pandemic and this relationship that we have with China, that there’s a lot of value in making things and to making things here.",Yes. Somebody’s got to do the real work.
Yeah.,"You know? Making a car, it’s an honest days living, that’s for sure. Making anything, really, or providing a valuable service like providing good entertainment, good information, these are all valuable things to do. Yeah, there should be more of it."
"Did you have a moment where, is this something that this idea of getting rid of your material possessions is it something that built up over time or did you have a moment of realization where you realized that …","Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it for a while. You know, part of it is like I have a bunch of houses, but I don’t spend a lot of time in most of them. That doesn’t seem like a good use of assets. Somebody could probably be enjoying those houses and get better use of them me."
Don’t you have Gene Wilder’s house?,I do.
That’s amazing.,It’s awesome.
Wow.,Yes. It’s exactly what you’d expect.
Did you request that the buyer not fuck it up?,"Yeah, that’s a requirement."
"Oh, a requirement? That’s a good requirement.",Yeah.
In that case in that house.,"Yeah, it’ll probably sell for less, but still I don’t care."
"Oh, he’s a legend. He’d want his soul, he’d want his essence in the building.",And it’s there.
Is it?,"It’s a real quirky house, yeah."
What makes you say that? What do you get out of it?,"I mean, all the cabinets are like handmade and they’re like odd shapes and there’s like doors to nowhere and strange corridors and tunnels and odd paintings on the wall. Yeah."
Did you ever live in it?,"It’s very quirky. I did live in it briefly, yeah."
"But why do you buy houses? If you own all these houses, do you just get bored and go I think I’d like to have that?","Well, I had one house and the Gene Wilder house is right across the road from me from my main house. It was going to get sold and then torn down and turned into, you know, be a big construction zone for three years. I was like, whoa, I think I’ll buy it and preserve the spirit of Gene Wilder and not have a giant construction zone. Then I started having some privacy issues where people would just come to my house and start climbing over the walls and stuff. I’m like, man …"

Then I started having some privacy issues where people would just come to my house and start climbing over the walls and stuff. I’m like, man …","Then I sort of bought some of the houses around my house and then I thought at one point, well you know, it’d be cool to build a house. I acquired some properties at the top of Somera Road, which has got a great view, and I was like, okay, well there’s a bunch of sort of small older houses, they’re going to get torn down, anyway. I was like, well, if I collect these little houses then I can build something, I don’t know, artistic like a dream house type of thing."
What’s a dream house for Elon Musk? Like some Tony stark type shit?,"Yeah, definitely. Yeah. You got to have the dome that opens up with the stealth helicopter and that kind of thing, you know?"
Yeah.,For sure.
Fuck yeah.,"Definitely. But then I was like, man, does it really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and I’d be real, you know, ghetto like OCD on the little details and the design, or should I be allocating that time to getting us to Mars? I should probably do the latter. Like what’s more important? Mars or a house? I’m like Mars. Okay."
"Is that really how you think? Like, I’d be better off planning on a trip to Mars or getting people to Mars?","Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, you can only do so many things."
Right.,"Right, so how are you going to [crosstalk 00:14:27]"
"Well, I don’t know how you do what you do anyway. I don’t understand how you can run The Boring Company, Tesla, SpaceX, all these different things you’re doing constantly. I just, I don’t understand. I mean, you explained last time you were here how you sort of allocate your time and how hectic it is and insane. I still don’t, the productivity is baffling. It just doesn’t make sense how you can get so much done.","Well, I think I do have high productivity, but even with that there’s still some opportunity to [inaudible 00:14:57] time and allocating time to building a house, even if it was a really great house, it still is not a good use of time relative to developing the rockets necessary to get us to Mars and helping solve sustainable energy. SpaceX and Tesla are by far, you know, the most amount of brain cycles. The Boring Company does not take, you know, it’s like less than 1% of brain cycles. Then this neural link, which is, I don’t know, maybe it’s like 5% and then …"
5%? That’s a good chunk.,"It’s a good chunk. Yeah, yeah."
"We were talking about that last time and you were trying to figure out when it was actually going to go live, when it’s actually going to be available. Are you testing on people right now?","No, we’re not testing on people yet, but I think it won’t be too long. I think we may be able to implant a neural link in less than a year in a person I think."
"When you do this, is there any tests that you have to do before you do something like this to see what percentage of people’s bodies are going to reject these things? Is there a potential for rejection?","It’s a very low potential for rejection. I mean, you can think of it like people put in heart monitors and things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation obviously like artificial hips and knees and that kind of thing. The probability of, I mean, so it’s well known what will cause rejection and what will not. It’s definitely harder when you’ve got something that is sort of reading and writing neurons that’s generating a current pulse and reading current pulses. That’s a little harder than say a passive device, but it’s still very doable. There are people who have primitive devices in their brains right now."
What kind of devices?,"Well, like deep brain stimulation, I think for Parkinson’s, has really changed people’s lives in a big way, which is kind of remarkable because it kind of like zaps your brain. It’s like kicking the TV type of thing. You think like man, kicking the TV shouldn’t work."
It does sometimes.,"Yeah, yeah."
The old TVs.,It did.
My grandpa used to slap the top.,For sure. Yeah.
It would work sometimes.,"Yeah, so this deep brain stimulation implanted devices in the brain have changed people’s lives for the better like fundamentally."
"Well, let’s talk about what you can talk about to what Neuralink is cause the last time you were here you really couldn’t discuss it. Then there was, I guess a press release or something that sort of outlined … [crosstalk 00:18:04]","Oh yeah, sure, sure."
"Yeah, that had happened quite a bit after the last time you were here. What exactly is it? How do you do, what happens if someone ultimately does get a Neuralink installed what will take place?","Well, for version one of the device, it would be it basically implanted in your skull. It would be flush with your skull, so you basically take out a chunk of skull, put the Neuralink device in there. You’d insert the electrode threads very carefully into the brain and then you stitch it up and you wouldn’t even know that somebody has it. It can interface basically anywhere in your brain. It could be something that helps cure say eyesight, like returns your eyesight even if you’ve lost your optic nerve type of thing."
Really?,"Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, pretty much anything that it could, in principle, fix almost anything that is wrong with the brain. It could restore limb functionality, so if you’ve got an interface into the motor cortex and then an implant that’s like a microcontroller and near muscle groups, you could then create sort of a neural shunt that restores somebody who is a quadriplegic to full functionality. Like they can walk around and be normal."
Whoa.,"Yeah, maybe slightly better."
Slightly better?,"Over time, yes."
You mean with future iterations?,"Like the, you know, $6 million man. Although these days that doesn’t sound like much."
"Right, that’s pretty cheap.",Yeah. Yeah.
$6 billion man.,Yeah.
"The hole would be small, how big would the hole be that you have to drill and then replace with this piece? It’s only one hole?","Well, yeah, the device we’re working on right now is about, it’s about an inch in diameter. Your skull is pretty thick, by the way."
Mine is for sure.,"It might actually, literally, I mean if you’re a big guy, your skull is actually fairly thick. A skull is like seven to 14 millimeters."
Mines probably a couple of inches.,"A half inch. Half inch thick skull ish. Yeah, yeah, that’s a fair bit of like … We’ve got quite a coconut going on there. It’s not like some eggshell."
"Oh yeah, I believe you.","Yeah, you basically implant the device."
"It would be like a one inch square? One inch in diameter, so an inch circle?","Yeah, think like a smartwatch or something like that."
"Oh, okay.",Yeah.
"Okay, so you take this one diameter like ice fishing, right? You ever go ice fishing?","No, but I’d like to."
"It’s great. It’s really fun, so you basically take an auger and you drill through the surface of the ice and you create a small hole. You can dunk your line in there. This is like that. You’re ice fishing on the top of your skull and then you cork it.","Yeah, and you replace that say one inch diameter piece of skull with the Neuralink device and that has a battery and a Bluetooth and an inductive charger. Then you also insert the electrodes. The electrodes are very carefully inserted with a robot that we developed. It’s very carefully putting in the electrodes and avoiding any veins or arteries so it doesn’t create trauma."
"Through this one inch diameter device, electrodes would be inserted and they will find their way …","Like tiny wires, basically."
Tiny wires.,Tiny wires.
They’ll find their way to specific areas of the brain to stimulate?,"No, you literally put them where they’re supposed to go."
"Oh, okay.","Yeah, you insert …"
How long would these wires be?,"I mean, they usually go in like, depending on where it is, like two or three millimeters."
They just find the spots?,Yeah.
Wow.,Then you put the device in and that replaces the little piece of skull that was taken out. Then you stitch up the hole and they just look like a little scar and that’s it.
Would this be replaceable or reversible?,Yeah.
"Like if someone can’t take it anymore? I’m too smart, I can’t take it.","Yeah, you can totally take it out."
"Besides restoring limb function and eyesight and hearing, which are all amazing, is there any cognitive benefits that you anticipate from something like this?","Yeah, I mean you could for sure, I mean, basically it’s a generalized sort of thing for fixing any kind of brain injury in principle, or if you’ve got like severe epilepsy or something like that. It could just sort of stop the epilepsy from occurring. It could detect it in real time and then fire a counter pulse and stop the epilepsy. I mean, there’s a whole range of brain injuries. Like if somebody gets a stroke, they could lose the ability to speak and that could also be fixed. If you’ve got like stroke damage or you lose say muscle control over part of your face or something like that. When you get older you tend to, if you’ve got like Alzheimer’s or something like that, then you lose memory and this could help you with restoring your memory and that kind of thing."
"Restoring memory and what is happening that’s allowing it to do that? Like the wires, these small wires are stimulating these areas of the brain. Is it that the areas of the brain are losing some sort of electrical force? What is happening?",Yeah.
Yeah?,The thing is it’s like a bunch of circuits and there’s some circuits that are broken and we can fix those circuits. It’s a substitute for those circuits.
A specific frequency will go through this?,Yeah.
"Is the process figuring out how much or how little has to be, how much these areas of the brain have to be juiced up?","Yeah. I mean, there’s still a lot of work to do. When I say we’ve got a shot at probably putting in a person within a year, that’s exactly what I mean. I think we have a chance of putting it into one and having them be healthy and restoring some functionality that they’ve lost."
The fear is that eventually you’re going to have to cut the whole top of someone’s head off and put a new top with a whole bunch of wires if you want to get the real turbo charged version. The P 100 D of brain stimulation.,"I mean, ultimately if you want to go with full AI symbiosis, you’ll probably want to do something like that."
Symbiosis is a scary word when it comes to AI.,It’s optional.
I would hope so.,Yeah.
"It’s just, I mean, once you enjoy the Doctor Manhattan lifestyle, once you become a god seems very unlikely you’re going to want to go back to being stupid again. I mean, you literally could fundamentally change the way human beings interface with each other.",Yes.
Yes.,You wouldn’t need to talk.
"I’m so scared of that, but so excited about it at the same time. Is that weird?","Yeah, I think this is one of the paths to think like what are … Like AI is getting better and better. Now let’s assume it’s sort of like a benign AI scenario. Even in a benign scenario, we’re kind of left behind. We’re not along for the ride. We’re just too dumb."
Right.,"How do you go along for the ride? It’s like you can’t beat them, join them. We’re already a cyborg to some degree, right? Cause you’ve got your phone, you’ve got your laptop."
Glasses.,"Yeah, yeah. Your electronic devices."
Yeah.,"Today, if you don’t bring your phone along it’s like you have missing limb syndrome. It feels like something’s really missing. We’re already partly a cyborg or an AI symbiote, essentially it’s just that the data rate to the electronics is slow. Especially output, like you’re just going with your thumbs. I mean like what’s your data rate? Optimistically, a hundred bits per second. That’s being generous."
"Today, if you don’t bring your phone along it’s like you have missing limb syndrome. It feels like something’s really missing. We’re already partly a cyborg or an AI symbiote, essentially it’s just that the data rate to the electronics is slow. Especially output, like you’re just going with your thumbs. I mean like what’s your data rate? Optimistically, a hundred bits per second. That’s being generous.","Now the computer can communicate at like a hundred terabytes. Certainly, you know, gigabits are trivial at this point. This is like, yeah, basically your computer could do things a million times faster. At a certain point it’s like talking to a tree. Okay? It’s just boring. You talk to a tree it’s not very entertaining. If you can solve the data rate issue and you’re especially output input, too, then you can improve the symbiosis that is already occurring between man and machine."
"You can improve it in what, when you said you won’t have to talk to each other anymore. We used to joke around about that. I’ve joked around about that a million times in this podcast that one day in the future there’s going to come a time where you can read each other’s minds. You’ll be able to interface with each other in some sort of a nonverbal, non-physical way where you will transfer data back and forth to each other without having to actually use your mouth. You’ll make noises.","Exactly, so when you … Like what happens when you, let’s say you’ve got some complex idea that you’re trying to convey to somebody else and how do you do that? Well, your brain spends a lot of effort compressing a complex concept into words and there’s a lot of loss, information loss that occurs when compressing a complex concept into words. Then you say those words and those words are then interpreted, then they’re decompressed by the person who is listening. They will, at best, get a very incomplete understanding of what you’re trying to convey. It’s very difficult to convey a complex concept with precision because you’ve got compression, decompression, you may not even have heard all the words correctly and so communication is difficult. What we have here is a failure to communicate. Cool add Luke."
Yes. Great movie.,"Yeah, great on."
"There’s an interpretation factor, too. Like you can choose to interpret certain series of words in different ways and they’re dependent upon tone, dependent upon social cues, even facial expressions, sarcasm. There’s a lot of variables.",Sarcasm is difficult.
Yes.,Yeah.
"…from first grade on, how to use some new universal language. I mean essentially like a Rosetta Stone and something that’s done, that interprets your thoughts and you can convey your thoughts with no room for interpretation. With clear, very clear, where you know what a person’s saying and you could tell them what you’re saying. There’s no need for noises, no need for mouth noises.",Yes.
"No need for these accepted ways that we’ve evolved to make sounds that we all agree, through our cultural dictionary, and we agree. We could bypass all that.",You can still do it for sentimental reasons.
Like campfires.,"Yeah, exactly. You don’t need campfire. Don’t need to roast marshmallows to have fun."
Right.,"So, yeah, I think you would, in principle you would be able to communicate very quickly and with far more precision ideas and language would, I’m not sure what would happen to language. You could probably in a situation like this, you would be able to just, it’d be kind of like the matrix. You want to speak a different language. No problem."
Right.,Just download the program.
"Right. So at least for the first iterations, first few iterations. I know that Google has some of their pixel buds have the ability to interpret languages in real time.",Sure.
Yeah. You can hear it and it’ll play things back to you in whatever language you choose. So it’d be something along those lines.,Yeah.
For the first few iterations.,"Well the first few iterations are, what I’m talking about is in the limit over time, with a lot of development. The first few iterations really in the first few versions all we’re going to be trying to do is solve brain injuries. So, don’t worry. It’s not going to sneak up on you. This will take awhile."
How many years? Before you don’t have to talk.,If the development continues to accelerate then maybe five years. Five to 10 years.
That’s quick. That’s really quick.,That’s the best case scenario.
No talking anymore in five years.,"Best case scenario, but 10 years is more like it."
"They’re like if you went from australopithecus or ancient hominid to us, what’s the difference? Less hair, less muscle, bigger head and then just keep going. A thousand, a million, whatever year or five years, whatever. Whatever happens when Neuralink goes on online and then we slowly start to adapt to this new way of being where we don’t use our muscles anymore. We have this gigantic head, we can talk without words.",You could also save state.
Save state?,Save your brain state like a saved game in a video game.
Whoa. Like if you want to swap from Windows 95.,"Well, hopefully a little better than that. But, yeah."
I think we are Windows 95 right now.,"From a [inaudible 00:34:54] perspective probably. But yeah, I mean you could save state and restore that state into a biological being if you wanted to in the future in principle, nothing from a physics standpoint that prevents us. Now, you’d be a little different, but then you’re also a little different when you wake up in the morning from yesterday and you’re a little different. In fact, if you say like you five years ago versus you today is quite a big difference."
Yes.,So you’d be substantially you. I mean you’d certainly think you’re you.
"But the idea of saving yourself and then transforming that into some sort of a biological state, you can hang out with 30 year old you?",I mean the possibilities are endless.
It’s so weird.,"I mean, just think like how your phone, you can record videos from your phone. There’s no way you could remember a video as accurately as your phone or a camera could. So now if you’ve got like some version 10 Neuralink, whatever and far in the future, you could recall everything, just like it’s a movie."
Crystal clear.,Including all the entire sensory experience.
"Emotions, everything.",Everything.
Everything.,Everything and play it back and in fact you can edit it.
Edit it?,Yeah.
So you can change your past?,You could change what you think was your past. Yeah.
"Well, so if you had a dramatic experience?",This whole thing right now could be a replayed memory.
It could be.,Yeah.
It may be. What’s the odds of this being a replayed memory? If you had a guess. More than 50%.,There’s no way to assign a probability with accuracy here.
"Right. But roughly, if you had a just gut instinct.","Well, I don’t have a Neuralink in my brain, so I’d say right now 0%, but at the point at which you do have a Neuralink, then it rises above 0%."
"The idea that we’re experiencing some sort of a preserved memory is, even though it’s still the same, it’s not comforting. Right? For some reason when people talk about simulation theory, they talk about the potential for this currently being a simulation. Even though your life might be wonderful, you might be in love, you might love your career, you might have great friends, but it’s not comforting to know that this experience somehow or another doesn’t exist in a material form that you can knock on.",It feels real doesn’t it?
"It feels real. But the idea that it’s not, for some strange reason, disconcerting.","Yeah. I’m sure, it should be disconcerting because if this is not real, what is? But, there’s that old sort of thought experiment of like, how do you know you’re not a brain in a vent? I mean now here’s the thing. You are a brain in a vent, then that vat is your skull."
Yes.,"Everything you see, feel, hear, everything, all your senses are electrical signals, everything. Everything is an electrical signal to a brain in a vent with a vat as our skull."
"All your hormones, all your neuro-transmitters, all these things are drugs. Adrenaline’s a drug. Dopamine is a drug. You’re a drug factory. You’re constantly changing your state with love and oxytocin and beauty.",Sure.
Changes your state. Great music changes your state.,"Absolutely. Yet, here’s another sort of interesting idea, which is, because you say like where did consciousness arise? Well, assuming you believe the belief in physics, which proves to be true, then the universe started off as basically quarks and leptons and it quickly became hydrogen and helium, lithium, basically elements of the periodic table. But it was mostly hydrogen basically. Then over a long period of time, 13.8 billion years later that hydrogen became sentient. What’s the line of consciousness and not consciousness between hydrogen and here?"
"When do we call it, when do we call it consciousness? I was watching a video today that we played on a podcast earlier of a monkey riding a motorcycle down the street, jumps off the motorcycle and tries to steal a baby.",Yeah. I saw that one. It went viral.
Is that monkey conscious? It seems like it is. It seems like it had a plan. It was riding a fucking motorcycle and then jumped off the motorcycle to try to steal a baby.,The one that just dragged the baby down the street pretty far?
"Yeah. It seems pretty conscious, right?",There’s definitely some degree of consciousness there.
"That one day will be so far removed from what this is. We’ll look back on this, the way we look back now on simple organisms that we evolved from. That it won’t be that far in the future that we do have this view back.","Well, I hope consciousness propagates into the future and it gets more sophisticated and complex and that it understands the questions to ask about the universe."
"Do you think that’s the case? As a human being, as yourself, you’re clearly trying to make conscious decisions to be a better version of you. This is the idea of like getting rid of your possessions and realizing that you’re trying to like, “I don’t like this. I will try to improve this. I would try to do a better version of the way I interface with reality.” That this is always the way things are, if you’re moving in some sort of a direction where you’re trying to improve things, you’re always going to move into this new place where you look back on the old place and go, “I was doing it wrong back then.” So this is an accelerated version of that. A super accelerated version of that.","I mean, you don’t always improve, but you can aspire to improve or you can aspire to be less wrong."
Yeah.,"This is like, I think the tools of physics are very powerful. Just assume you’re wrong and your goal is to be less wrong. I don’t think you’re going to succeed every day in being less wrong, but if you’re going to succeed in being less wrong, most of the time you’re doing great."
"That’s a great way of putting it. Aspire to be less wrong. But then when people look back in nostalgia about simpler times, there’s that too. It’s very romantic and exciting to look back on campfires.",You can still have a campfire.
Yes. But will you appreciate it when you’re a super nerd? When you connect it to the grid and you have some skull cap in place of the top of your head and it’s interfacing with the international language that the rest of the universe now enjoys communication with people?,Yeah. Sure. I think so. Yeah. I like campfires.
"I’m just worried. I mean, everyone’s always scared of change, but I’m scared of this monumental change where we won’t talk anymore. I mean that thing that you [crosstalk 00:42:53].",We’ll communicate.
"Yes, but there’s something about the beauty of the crudeness of language where when it’s done eloquently, it’s satisfying and it hits us in some sort of a visceral way. Like, ah, that person nailed it. I love that they nailed it. That it’s so hard to capture a real thought and convey it in a way, in this articulate way. You read a quote, a great quote by a wise person. It makes you excited that their mind figured something out, put the words together in a right way that makes your brain pop like, “Oh yes. Yes.”",It’s clever compression of a concept and a feeling.
But the fact that a human did it too.,"Yeah, absolutely."
Do you think that it will be like electronic music? Like people won’t appreciate it like they appreciate a slide guitar?,I like electronic music.
I do too. Well you make it. I know you like it.,Sure.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.","Yeah, I mean I hope the future is more fun and interesting and we’re just trying to make it that way."
I hope it’s more fun and interesting too.,Yeah.
I just hope we don’t lose anything along the way.,"We might lose a little, but hopefully we gain more than lose."
"Yeah. That’s the thing, right? Gaining more than we lose. Something that makes us interesting is that we’re so flawed.","It’s not for sure. Yeah. I mean you look at civilization through the ages, most of them they rose and fell."
Yeah.,"I do think the globalization that we have, sort of like the meme sphere, is there’s not enough isolation between countries or regions. It’s like if you get, if there’s a mind virus that that mind virus can infect too much of the world. I actually sort of sympathize with the anti-globalization people, because it’s like, man, we don’t ever want everywhere to be the same for sure. Then we need some kind of mind viral immunity. So that’s a bit concerning."
"Mind viral immunity, meaning that once something like Neuralink gets established, the real concern is something that, I mean you said it’s Bluetooth, right? Or some future version of that. The idea is that something could possibly get into it, fuck it up.","No, I’m talking about like somebody, some cockeyed concept that happens right now."
"Well I know this virus is in embedded chips, right? They’ve embedded chips and then acquired viruses.","Well, when I’m talking about a mind virus, I’m talking about a concept that infects people’s minds."
"Oh, okay. Okay. Like cult thinking or some sort of fundamentalism.",Yeah. It’s just wrongheaded idea that goes viral in an idea sense.
"Well that is a problem too, right? If someone can manipulate that technology to make something appear logical or rational.",Yeah. Yeah.
"Would that be an issue too, this is a very have versus have not issue. If this really does, I mean initially it’s going to help people with injuries, but you said ultimately it could lead to this spectacular cognitive change.",Yes.
But the people that first get it should have a massive advantage over people that don’t have it yet.,"Well, I mean it’s the kind of thing where your productivity would improve, I don’t know, dramatically, maybe by a factor of 10 with it. So you could definitely just, I don’t know, take out a loan and do it and earn the money back real fast. Be super smart."
"Well in a capitalist society, it seems like you could really get so far ahead that before everybody else could afford this thing and link up and get connected as well. You’d be so far ahead, they can never catch you. Is that a concern?","Well, it’s not a super huge concern. I mean there are huge differences in cognitive ability and resources already. You can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective that’s far smarter than an individual. I couldn’t personally build a whole rocket and the engines and launch it and everything. That’s impossible."
"Well, it’s not a super huge concern. I mean there are huge differences in cognitive ability and resources already. You can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective that’s far smarter than an individual. I couldn’t personally build a whole rocket and the engines and launch it and everything. That’s impossible.","But we have 8,000 people at SpaceX and you’re piecing it out to different people and using computers and machines and stuff. We can make lots of rockets launch into orbit, dock with the space station and that kind of thing. So that already exists where those corporations are vastly more capable than an individual. But we should be, I think less concerned about relative capabilities between people and more like having AI be vastly beyond us and decoupled from human will."
"Decoupled from human. So this is the, if you can’t beat them, join them?",Yeah.
"So you feel like it’s inevitable, AI, essentially AI is essentially inevitable.","Super sentient to AI. Yeah, like beyond a level that’s difficult to understand and impossible to understand probably."
"Somehow or another, so it’s almost like it’s a requirement for survival to achieve some sort of symbiotic existence with AI.","It’s not a requirement. It’s just if you want to be along for the ride then you need to do some kind of symbiosis. So the way your brain works right now, you’ve got kind of like the animal brain, reptile brain, kind of like the lymphic system basically. You’ve got the cortex. Now the brain purist will argue with this definition, but essentially you’ve got the primitive brain and you’ve got the sort of smart brain or the brain that’s capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey can’t understand."

Now the brain purist will argue with this definition, but essentially you’ve got the primitive brain and you’ve got the sort of smart brain or the brain that’s capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey can’t understand.","Now your cortex is much, much smarter than your lymphic system. Nonetheless, they work together well. So I haven’t met anyone who wants to delete their lymphic system or their cortex. People are quite happy having both. So you can think of this as being like the computer, the AI is like a third layer, a tertiary layer. So that could be symbiotic with the cortex. It’d be much smarter than the cortex, but you essentially have three layers and you actually have that right now."
"Now your cortex is much, much smarter than your lymphic system. Nonetheless, they work together well. So I haven’t met anyone who wants to delete their lymphic system or their cortex.

It’d be much smarter than the cortex, but you essentially have three layers and you actually have that right now.","Your phone is capable of things and your computer is capable of things that your brain is definitely not. Storing terabytes of information perfectly, doing incredible calculations that we couldn’t even come close to doing. You have that with your computer. It’s just like I said, the data rate is slow, the connection is weak."
"Why is it so disconcerting or why does it not give me comfort to think about? Like when I think about a symbiotic connection to AI, I always think of this cold, emotionless sort of thing that we will become. Is that a bad way to look at it?","I don’t think, that’s not how it would be. Like I said you already are symbiotic with AI or computers."
"Phones, computers, laptops.","Yeah, there’s quite a bit of AI going on, artificial neural nets. Increasingly, neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming more and more. So you are connected, if you use Google Voice or Alexa or one of those things, it’s using a neural net to decode your speech and try understand what you were saying."
"Yeah, there’s quite a bit of AI going on, artificial neural nets. Increasingly, neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming more and more. So you are connected, if you use Google Voice or Alexa or one of those things, it’s using a neural net to decode your speech and try understand what you were saying.","If you’re trying to do image recognition or improve the quality of photograph, the neural nets the best way to do that. So you are already sort of a cybernetic symbiote. Like I said, it’s just a question of your data rate. The communication speed between your phone and your brain is slow."
When do you think you’re going to do it? How long will you wait? Once it starts becoming available?,"Yeah, if it works I’ll do it. Sure."
Right away.,I mean let’s make sure it works.
How do we make sure it works? We try it on prisoners? What do you do? Take rapists? Cut holes in their head?,"No, like I said, if somebody has got a serious brain injury and people that have very severe brain injuries and then you can fix those brain injuries. Then you prove out that it works and [inaudible 00:53:06] expand and make more and more brain injuries, solve more and more. At a certain age we all are going to get Alzheimer’s or we’re all going to get senile. Then moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing."
"No, like I said, if somebody has got a serious brain injury and people that have very severe brain injuries and then you can fix those brain injuries.

At a certain age we all are going to get Alzheimer’s or we’re all going to get senile. Then moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing.","It’s like you said, okay, well this would allow you to remember your names of your kids and have a normal, a much more normal life where you were able to function much later in life. So I think essentially almost everyone would find a need at some point if you get old enough to use Neuralink. Then it’s like, okay, so we can improve the functionality and improve the communication speed. So then you will not have to use your thumbs to communicate with the computer."
Do you ever sit down and extrapolate? Do you ever sit down and think about all the different iterations of this and what this eventually leads to?,"Yeah, sure. I Think about it a lot. Like I said, this is not something that’s going to sneak up on you. Getting FDA approval for this stuff is not overnight. I don’t know, we probably have to be on version 10 or something before it would realistically be a human AI symbiote situation. You’ll see it coming."
"You see it coming, but when do you think it’s going to be? When you’re alone, if you have free time, I don’t know if you have free time, but if you just sit down and think about this iteration, the next onward, keep going and you drag it out with improvements along the way and leaps and bounds and technological innovations. Where do you see it? What are we going to be?",Like when?
"20, 25 years from now? What are we going to be?","Well, assuming civilization is still around, it’s looking fragile right now. I think we could have, in 25 years probably I would think there could be a whole brain interface."
A whole brain interface?,Something pretty close to that. Yeah.
What do you mean by whole brain interface?,Almost all the neurons are connected to the sort of AI extension of yourself. If you want.
AI extension of yourself.,Yeah.
"What does that mean to you, when you say AI Extension of yourself?","Well, like I said, you already have a computer extension of yourself and your phone and computers and stuff. So, and now online it’s like somebody dies, there’s like an online ghost that they’re still, their online stuff is still alive."
That’s a good way to put it. It is weird when you read someone’s tweets after they’re dead.,Yeah.
Yeah.,"Instagram and their stories and yeah, whatever Facebook and stuff."
That’s a great way to put it. It’s like an online ghost. That’s very accurate.,"Yeah. So it would just be that more of you would be in the cloud, I guess, than in your body or more of you."
"Whoa. Now, when you say civilization’s fragile, do you mean because of this COVID-19 shit that’s going on right now?",What’s that? I never heard of it.
"It’s this thing, it’s like some people just get a cough.",I have no idea what you’re talking about.
Other people it gets much worse.,"Sure. Well, yeah. I mean this certainly has taken over the mind space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking."
"Then in other places it just ravages entire communities and kills people and it’s so weird. It almost appears, if you didn’t know any better, you’d be like, what? It seems like there’s a bunch of different viruses. It doesn’t seem like it’s the same thing or has a bunch of different reactions to the biological variety of people.","Yeah, I mean I kind of saw this whole thing play out in China before it played out in the US. So it’s kind of like watching the same movie again, but in English. Yeah, I think the mortality rate is much less than what say the World Health Organization said it was. It’s much, much less. It’s like probably at least order of magnitude less."
"Well, it seems to be very deadly to very specific kinds of people and people with specific problems.","Yeah. I mean, you can look at the mortality statistics by age and whether they have comorbidities, like do they have basically existing conditions and by age. If you’re below 60 and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low. It’s not zero, but it’s extremely low."
"They didn’t think that this was the case though, when they first started to lock down the country. Do you think that it’s a situation where once they’ve proceeded in a certain way, it’s very difficult to correct course?",It’s almost like people really wanted a panic. It’s quite crazy.
"But in some places a panic is deserved, right? Like if you’re in the ICU in Manhattan and people are dying left and right and everyone’s on intubators. It seems like when you see all these people on ventilators and so many of them are dying and you see these nurses are dying and doctors are getting sick. In some places that fear is justified, but then in other places you’re reading these stories about hospitals that are essentially half empty. They’re having to furlough doctors and nurses because there’s no work for them.",Most of the hospitals in the United States right now are half empty. In some cases they’re at 30% capacity.
Is this because they’ve decided to forgo elective procedures and normal things that people would have to go to the hospital for?,"Yes. I mean, we’re not talking about just some of these elective procedures are quite important. Like you have a bad heart."
"Gall bladder disease, yeah, sure.","You need a triple bypass. It’s sort of elective, but if you don’t get it done in time, you’re going to die."
"Yeah, elective is a weird word.","Elective. It’s not like, this isn’t like plastic surgery."
"Right, right.","It’s more like my hip is, I’m in extreme pain because my hip’s blown out or my knee and I don’t want to go to the hospital. I can’t go to the hospital. People are in extreme pain, people that need a kidney, people that have quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear. So I think it’s a problem that’s not good."
It seems.,So I think it’s a problem that’s not good.
It seems like the state of public perception is shifting.,It is.
"Like people are taking some deep breaths and relaxing and because of the statistics, essentially across the board it’s being recognized that it’s not as fatal as we thought it was. Still dangerous, still worse than a flu, but not as bad as we thought or we feared it could be.","Objectively the mortality is much lower. At least a factor of 10, maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought."
"Do you think that the current way we’re handling this, the social distancing, the mask, the locking down, does this make sense? Is it adequate? Or do you think that we should move back to at least closer to where we used to be?","Well, I think proper hygiene is a good thing no matter what."
Yes.,"Wash your hands and if you’re coughing, stay at home or wear a mask because it’s not good. They do that in Japan. That’s normal. If you’re ill you wear a face mask and you don’t cough on people. I think that would be a great thing to adopt in general throughout the world. Washing your hands is also good."
Well there’s a speculation why men get it more than women because men are disgusting. We don’t wash our hands as much.,Men are disgusting it’s true. It’s bad.
"It’s true, I admit it, we are all men in this room. We’re all gross.",Yeah. Just go to the restroom you can see it’s horrible.
"Yes we’re gross. My nine year old daughter yells at me, she goes, “Did you wash your hands?” She makes me go back and wash my hands. She’s right. Nine years old. If I had a nine year old boy do you think he would care? He wouldn’t give a fuck if I washed my hands.",True. And I think that there’s definitely some silver linings here in improved hygiene and-
And awareness of potential.,"Yes. I think this has shaken up the system. the system is somewhat moribund with lot of layers of bureaucracy and I think that we’ve cut through some of that bureaucracy. And at some point there probably will be a pandemic with a high mortality rate. Debate about like what’s high. but I mean something that’s killing a lot of 20 year olds, let’s say. Like if you had Ebola type of mortality."
"Spanish flu, something that attacks the immune systems of healthy people.","Yeah. Like killing large numbers of young healthy people, to find that as like a high mortality than that. This is at least practice for something like that. And I think there’s this, given it’s just a matter, that there will be eventually some such pandemic."
"Do you think that in a sense, the one good thing that we might get out of this is the realization that this is a potential reality? That we got lucky in the sense?, I mean people that didn’t get lucky and died, of course I’m not disrespecting their death and their loss, but I’m saying overall as a culture, as a community, as a human race, as a community, this is not as bad as it could have been. This is a good dry run for us to appreciate that we need far more resources dedicated towards understanding these diseases, what to do in the case of pandemic, and much more money that goes to funding treatments and some preventative measures.","Yeah, absolutely. And I think there’s a good chance, it’s highly likely, I think, coming out of this that we will develop vaccines that we didn’t have before for coronaviruses, other viruses, and possibly cures for these. And our understanding of viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it’s received. So there’s definitely a lot of silver linings here."
"Potentially, if we act correctly.",Yeah. I think there will be a massive lining of here no matter what. Hopefully we can be more of a silver lining than less.
Yeah.,"So yeah, this is just kind of like a practice run for something that might in the future have a serious, like a really high mortality rate and we kind of got to go through this without it being something that kills vast numbers of young healthy people."
"Yeah. When you made a series of tweets recently, I don’t remember the exact wording, but essentially you were saying, “Free America now.” Like, let’s open it back-",That is the exact wording.
"That is it? Thank you. How much do you pay attention to the response to that stuff and what was the response like? Did anybody go, “Hey man, what the fuck you doing?” Did anybody pull you aside?","Yeah, of course."
Who does that? Who gets to do that to you?,"Well, I mean, I certainly get that. There’s no shortage of negative feedback on Twitter. I get it."
"Oh yeah. Twitter. Yeah, but I don’t read that. Do you read it.",It’s a war zone.
"You do sometimes though, right? You do read it?","Yeah. I mean, I scroll through the comments. Like I said, it’s a meme war zone."
Yeah.,"I mean, people knife you good and thorough."
"They just start, “Da, da, da.” T`hey start gunning down things that are in front of them without any realization of what they’re doing. They have a rock, they see a window, they throw it. “Whoo, look at that. I got Elon mad. Look at that. This guy got mad at me. I fucking took this person down on Twitter. I got this lady fired. Oh, the fucking business is going under because of Twitter Wars.” It seems like there’s something about it that’s this new found thing that, I don’t want to say abuse, but just, I want to say that it’s almost like you hit the button and things blow up. You’re like, “Wow, what else can we blow up?”","Sure. I mean, I’ve been in the Twitter war zone for, for a while here, so."
Twitter war zone.,And it takes a lot to phase me at this point.
"Yeah, that’s good too. Right? Like you develop a thick skin.","Yeah. You can’t take it personally. A lot of these people don’t actually know you. It’s like if you’re fighting a war and there’s like some opposing soldier that shoots at you, it’s not like they hate you. They don’t even know you."
Right.,Yeah.
Yeah.,"So just think of it like that. Like they have fire and bullets, whatever. But they don’t know you, so don’t take it personally."
"There’s something interesting about it too. When you write something in 280 characters and they write something, it’s such a crude way. It’s like someone sending opposing smoke signals. Your smoke signals. It’s so crude. And especially when you’re talking about something like Neuralink. You’re talking about some future potential where you’re going to be able to express pure thoughts that get conveyed through some sort of a universal language with no ambiguity whatsoever versus tweets.","Well, there will always be some ambiguity, but tweets, it’s hard. But maybe there should be like a sarcasm flag or something."
"Right, right.",Or a “just kidding” or-
"It seems like it would take away some of the fun from people that know it’s sarcasm. Like if everybody knew that The Onion wasn’t, if you sent people articles. It was something about someone getting angry and an Onion article.","Wow, that’s amazing."
You know what I mean? Where they don’t realize what it is. There’s something fun about that for everybody else.,"Yeah, I think it’s pretty great. It might be the best news source."
"Do you know who Titania McGrath is? It’s Andrew Boyle. He’s a British fellow. Brilliant guy who’s been on the podcast before and he has this a fictional character, this a pseudonym Titania McGrath who’s like the ultimate social justice warrior.","Is this, like, a female avatar."
Yes.,"Oh, okay."
"A female avatar that’s actually a computer conglomeration of a bunch of faces. It’s not really one person. So, one person can’t be a victim and be angry, but he’s sort of combined these faces to make this one perfect social justice warrior. But I recognized it early on before I met him. That this was parody. This was just fun. And then I love reading the people that don’t recognize that. They get angry. And there’s a lot of people that just get really furious. There’s some fun to that. There’s some fun to the not picking up on the true nature of the signal.",I find Twitter quite engaging.
How do you have the time?,"Well, I mean like five minutes every couple of hours type thing. It’s not like I’m sitting on it all day."
"But even five minutes every couple hours, if those are bad five minutes, they might be bouncing around your head for the next 30.","Yeah, you have to, like I said, take a certain amount of distance from… You read this and be like, “Okay, it’s bullets being fired by an opposing army.” Like I said, it’s not like they know you. Don’t take it personally."
Did you feel the same way when CNN had that stupid shit about ventilators with you? I found that both confusing and-,Yeah. That was annoying.
It was annoying.,It was wrong.
What is also annoying as a person who reads CNN and wants to think of them as a responsible conveyor of the facts. I would like to think that-,"Well, yeah. I don’t think CNN is that."
I think used to be used to be.,"Used to be, yeah. What do you think’s the best source of just information out there?"
That’s a good question.,"Let’s say you’re just the average citizen trying to just get the facts, figure out what’s going on. How to live your life and just looking for what’s going on in the world. It’s hard to find something that’s good."
Yeah.,"Not trying to push some partisan angle, not trying to not doing sloppy reporting, and just aim it for the most number of clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars and that kind of thing. You’re just trying to figure out what’s going on. It’s like, I’m hard pressed. Where do you go?"
"I don’t know. I don’t think there’s any pure form. My favorite places are the New York times and the LA times and I don’t trust them a hundred percent. Because also, there’s individuals that are writing these stories. And that’s seems to be the problems, these individual biases and these individual, there’s purposely distorted perceptions, and then there’s ignorantly reported facts, and there’s so many variables. And you got to put everything through this filter of, “Where’s this person coming from? Did they have political biases? Did they have social biases? Are they upset because of their own shortcomings? And are they projecting this into the story?” It’s so hard.",Yeah. I think maybe just trying to find individual reporters that you think are good and kind of following them as opposed to publication.
I go with whatever Matt Taibbi says.,Okay.
I trust him more than anybody.,All right.
"Matt Taibbi is onto something. As far as investigative reporters in particular, the way he reported the savings and loan crisis, the way he reports everything. I just listened to him above most above most. He’s my go to guy.",All right. I’ll check it out.
"Oh, his Rolling Stone articles are amazing. His stuff on the savings and loan crisis, it’s just like, “What in the fuck?” And he’s not an economist by any stretch of the imagination. So he had to really deeply embedded himself in that world to try to understand it and to be able to report on it. And with also with a humorous flare.",Now that’s nice.
"Things are changing. Like, no one knows the correct process that needs to take place to save the most amount of lives, but yet ensure that our culture and that our economy survives. It’s a lot of speculation and guessing. But if you go to certain places, they’ll tell you, “We know why, and we know this, and we know…” Oh, it’s hard.","Yeah. I mean, in general I think we should be concerned about anything that’s a massive infringement on us. Civil liberties."
Yes.,"So, you got to put a lot of weight on that. A lot of people died to win independence for the country and fight for the democracy that we have. And we should treasure that and not give up our liberties too easily. And I think we probably did that, actually. So."
"Well, I like what you said when you said that it should be a choice and that to require people to stay home, require people to not go to work, and to arrest people for trying to make a living. This all seems wrong. And I think it’s a wrong approach. It’s an infantilization of the society. That daddy’s going to tell you what to do.","Fundamentally a violation of the constitution. Freedom of assembly and it’s just, I don’t think these things stand up in court, really."
"They’re arresting people for protesting because they’re protesting and violating social distancing, and these mandates that tell people that they have to stay home.",Yeah. These would definitely not stand up if the Supreme court… It’s obviously a complete violation of rights.
"And again, this is not in any way disrespecting the people who have died from this disease. That’s certainly a real thing to think of.","Yeah. I mean it just should be if you’re at risk, you should not be compelled to leave your house or leave a place of safety, but if you’re not at risk, or if you are at risk and you wish to take a risk with your life, you should have the right to do that."
"And it seems like at this point in time, particularly, our resources would be best served protecting the people that are at risk versus penalizing the people that are not at high risk for living their life the way they did, particularly having a career, and making a living, and feeding your family, paying your bills, keeping your store open, keeping your restaurant open.","Yes. I mean, there’s a strong downside to this. So yeah, I just believe this is a free country. You should be allowed to do what you want as long as it does not endanger others."
"One argument is we need to keep going, protect the weak, protect the sick, but let’s open up the economy. The other argument is stop placing money over human lives and let’s shelter in place until we come up with some sort of a decision and let’s figure out some way to develop some sort of a universal income, universal basic income plan, or something like that, to feed people during this time while we make this transition.","Yeah. I think there’s a, as I said, my opinion is if somebody wants stay home, they should stay home. If somebody doesn’t want to stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home. That’s my opinion. If somebody doesn’t like that, well that’s my opinion. This notion though, that you can just sort of send checks out to everybody and things will be fine is not true."
"Yeah. I think there’s a, as I said, my opinion is if somebody wants stay home, they should stay home. If somebody doesn’t want to stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home. That’s my opinion. If somebody doesn’t like that, well that’s my opinion. This notion though, that you can just sort of send checks out to everybody and things will be fine is not true.","Obviously several have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty. Like it just makes stuff. There’s just a magic horn of plenty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of plenty. And then if somebody has more stuff than somebody else it’s because they took more from this magic horn of plenty. Now let me just break it to the fools out there."
"Obviously several have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty. Like it just makes stuff. There’s just a magic horn of plenty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of plenty. And then if somebody has more stuff than somebody else it’s because they took more from this magic horn of plenty. Now let me just break it to the fools out there.","If you don’t make stuff, there’s no stuff. Yeah. So, if you don’t make the food, if you don’t process the food, you don’t transport the food, medical treatment, getting your teeth fixed, there’s no stuff. They’ve become detached from reality. You can’t just legislate money and solve these things. If you don’t make stuff, there is no stuff, obviously. we’ll run out of the stores, run out of the… the machine just grinds to a halt."
"But the initial thought on this virus, the real fear was that this was going to kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, instantaneously in this country. It was going to do it very quickly if we didn’t hunker down, if we didn’t shelter in place, if we didn’t quarantine ourselves, or lock down. Do you think that the initial thought was a good idea based on the perception that this was going to be far more deadly than it turned out to be?",Maybe. I think briefly.
Briefly?,"Briefly, but I think if any kind of sensible examination of what happened in China would lead you to conclusion that that is obviously not going to occur. This virus retreated in Wuhan. There’s was like, I don’t know, hundred thousand people a day leaving Wuhan. So, it went everywhere very fast throughout China, throughout the rest of the world, and the fatality rate was low."
"Don’t you think though, it’s difficult to filter the information that’s coming out of China. To accurately, really get a real true representation of what happened. The propaganda machine is very strong. The World Health Organization appears to have been complicit with a lot of their propaganda.","The thing is that American companies have massive supply chains in China. Like Tesla, for example. We have hundreds of suppliers. Like tier one, two, three, four suppliers throughout China. So, we know if they are able to make stuff or not. We know if they, if they have issues or not. China is back at full steam and pretty much every US company has some significant number of suppliers in China. So you know if they’re able to provide things or not or if there’s high mortality rate. Tesla has like 7,000 people in China. So, zero people died."
Mm-hmm (affirmative).,Zero.
Okay. So that’s a real statistic that’s coming from-,Yeah.
Yeah. You know those people.,Yeah. We literally run payroll.
Do you think there’s a danger of this… Yeah?,I’m like-
Same folks are there,Yeah. Still there.
"Do you think there’s a danger of politicizing this? Where this becomes like opening up the country as Donald Trump’s, it’s his goal and then anything he does, there’s people that are going to oppose it and come up with some reasons why he’s wrong, particularly in this climate, where as we’re leading up to November and the 2020 elections. Do you think that this is a real danger in terms of public’s perception that Trump wants to open it up so they knee jerk oppose it because they oppose Trump?","I think this has been politicized in both directions, really. Which is not great. Yeah. But like I said [inaudible 01:25:54] I think there’s the question of where do civil liberties fit in this picture? And what can the government make you do, what can they make you not do, and what’s okay? And I think we went too far."
"Do you think it’s one of those things where once we’ve gone in this certain direction, it’s very difficult to make a correction? Make an adjustment to realize like, okay, we thought it was one thing. It’s not good, but it’s not what we thought it was going to be. It’s not what we feared, so let’s back up, and reconsider, and let’s do this publicly and say we were acting based on the information that we had initially. That information appears to be faulty and here’s how we move forward while protecting civil liberties, while protecting what essentially this country is founded on, which is a very agreed upon amount of freedom that we respect and appreciate.","Absolutely. Well, I think we’re rapidly moving towards opening up the country. It’s going to happen extremely fast over the next few weeks. So, yeah. Something that would be helpful just to add from an informational level is when reporting Covid cases to separate out diagnosed with Covid versus had Covid like symptoms."
Yes.,"Because the list of symptoms that could be Covid at this point is like a mile long. So, it’s hard to, if you’re ill at all it’s like you could recover it. So, just to give people better information. Definitely diagnosed with Covid or had Covid like symptoms. We’re conflating those two so that it looks bigger than it is. Then if somebody dies, was Covid a primary cause of the death or not? I mean, if somebody has Covid, gets eaten by a shark, we find their arm, their arm has Covid, it’s going to get recorded as a Covid death."
Is that real?,Basically.
"Not that bad, but heart attacks, strokes-",You get hit by a bus.
Cancer.,"If you get hit by a bus, go to the of the hospital and die, and they find that you have Covid, you will be recorded as a Covid death."
Why would they do that though?,"Well right now, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I mean, it’s mostly paved with bad intentions, but there’s some good intentions [inaudible 01:28:37] in there, too. And the stimulus bill that was intended to help with the hospitals that were being overwrought with Covid patients created an incentive to record something as Covid that is difficult to say no to, especially if your hospital’s going bankrupt for lack of other patients. So, the hospitals are in a bind right now. There’s a bunch of hospitals, they’re furloughing doctors, as you were mentioning. If your hospital’s half full, it’s hard to make ends meet. So now you’ve got like, “If I just check this box, I get $8,000. Put them on a ventilator for five minutes, I get $39,000 back. Or, I got to fire some doctors.” So, this is tough moral quandary. It’s like, what are you going to do? That’s the situation we have."
"What the way out of this? What do you think is, if you had the president’s ear, or if people wanted to just listen to you openly, what do you think is the way out of this?","Let’s clear up the data. Clear up the data. So like I said, somebody should be recorded as Covid only if somebody has been tested. Has has received a positive, positive Covid test. Not if they simply have symptoms, one of like a hundred symptoms. And then if it is a Covid death, it must be separated. Was Covid a primary reason for death, or did they also have stage three cancer, or heart disease, emphysema, and got hit by bus and had Covid?"
Yeah. I’ve read all this stuff about them diagnosing people as a Covid death despite other variables.,This is not a question. This is what is occurring.
And where are you reading this from? Where are you getting this from?,The public health officials have literally said this. This is not a question mark.
"Right. But this is unprecedented, right? If someone had the flu but also had a heart attack, they would assume that that person died of a heart attack.",Yes.
"Yeah. So this is unprecedented. Is this because this is such a popular, I don’t want to use that word the wrong way, but that’s what I mean, popular subject? And financial incentives.","Yes. And like I said, this is not some sort of a moral [inaudible 01:31:07] of hospital administrators. It’s just, they’re in it. They’re in a tough spot here. They actually don’t have enough patients to pay everyone without furloughing doctors and firing staff. They’re running potentially going bankrupt. So then they’re like, “Okay, well the stimulus bill says we get all this money if it’s a Covid death.” I’m like, “Okay. They coughed before they died.” In fact, they’re not even diagnosed with Covid. If you had weakness, a cough, shortness of breath. Frankly, I’m not sure how you die without those things."
"Right. There’s so many different things that you could attribute to Covid, too. There’s so many symptoms. There’s diarrhea, headaches, dehydration, cough.","Yes. But to be clear, you don’t even need to have gotten a Covid diagnosis. You simply need to have had one of many symptoms and then have died for some reason and it’s Covid. So, then it makes the death count look very high and we’re then stuck in a bind because it looks like the death count’s super high and not going down like it should be. So then, we should keep whatever, keep the shelter in place stuff there, and keep people in their homes, confine people to homes. So we need to break out of this. We’re stuck in a loop. And I think the way to break out of this loop is to have clarity of information."
"…there’s a lot of, essentially… Well at least a month ago, we’re clearly in a panic. I mean, when you look around April 5th, April 6th, people were really freaking out. But here we are May, and May people are relaxing a little bit.",Yes.
"They’re realizing like, “Hey, I actually know a couple of people that got it. It was just a cough,” and I know some people that got it where nothing happened.","I know a lot of people who got it. I know zero people who died, but I know a lot of people that got it."
It’s not what we feared. We feared something much worse.,That is correct.
"So the adjustment’s difficult to make. So you said, first of all we need real data. We need-","Just parse out the data. Don’t lump it all together. If you give people, just parse out the data better, clearer information about, like I said, was this an actual COVID diagnosis? Did they get the test and the test came back positive or do they just have some symptoms? Just parse those two out, and then parse out just, if somebody died, did they even have a COVID test or did they just have one of many symptoms. How do you die without weakness? I don’t know. It’s impossible, basically."
"Of course. Yeah, it’s a good point.","If you’re going to die, you’re going to have shortness of breath, weakness and you might cough a little."
So was it quantified? Was it?,"Yeah, did that person, did they actually have a COVID test and the test come back positive? And then if they died, did they die where COVID was… It doesn’t have to be the main cause, but it was a significant contributor to their death or was it not a significant contributor to the death?"
"Right. It’s not as simple as just because you had COVID, covert, killed you.",Definitely not.
Yeah.,"I mean, people die all the time and they have like flu and other colds and we don’t say that they died of those flu and other colds."
"Well, that’s what’s so weird about this.",It’s absurd.
"It’s so popular and I use that word in a weird way, but it’s so popular that we’ve kind of forgotten people die of pneumonia every day.",Yeah.
"People die of… The flu didn’t take a break. “Oh, COVID’s got this. I’m going to sit this one out. I’m going to be on the bench. I’m going to wait until COVID’s done before I jump back into the game of killing people.” No, the flu is still here killing people.","I mean, every year in the world, several hundred thousand people die directly of the flu."
Yeah.,Not tangentially.
Right.,Not every-
"61,000 in this country last year.",Yeah. And we’re only 5% of the world.
And then there’s cigarettes.,"So, oh man, cigarettes. Now cigarettes will really kill you."
"That’s a weird one. Right? We’re terrified of this disease that we’re projected. It could potentially kill 100,000 if not 200,000 Americans this year. But With cigarettes kill 500,000 and you don’t hear a peep out of any politician. There’s no one running for Congress that’s trying to ban cigarettes. There’s no one running for Senate that wants to put some education plan in place that’s going to stop cigarettes in their tracks.","Yeah. I mean, several years ago, or maybe longer, 10 years ago, I helped make a movie called Thank You for Smoking."
"Oh, I saw that.","Yeah. It’s, it’s crazy. Barbecuing your lungs is just bad news. It’s not good. Turning your lungs into smoked beef, not great. So yeah. Tylenol, by the way, also kills a lot of people."
What is the number for Tylenol every year?,"I’m not sure the exact number. But until the opioid crisis, I believe Tylenol was the number one killer of all drugs."
Wow.,"Because basically, if you get drunk and take a lot of Tylenol, acetaminophen, essentially it causes liver failure. So people would like get wasted and then have a headache and then pop a ton of Tylenol, its curtains."
Wow.,Yeah.
Curtains is a funny word.,"Yeah. But nobody’s, raging against Tylenol."
"Yeah. It’s weird. Acceptable deaths are weird. And that’s the slippery slope about this. People shaming people for wanting to go back to work. “And other people are going to die.” Well, if you drive, do you drive? [inaudible 01:37:40] you should stop driving because people die from driving. So you, you definitely should fill up all the swimming pools because like 50 people die every day in this country from swimming. So let’s not swim anymore.","Yeah, water is really dangerous."
We need to chop down all the coconut trees.,Stop water.
Coconuts kill 150 people every year.,Yes.
Cut down all the coconut trees. We need those people.,Yes.
"It’s, at a certain point in time, it’s… Yeah, we’re vulnerable and also, we have a finite existence no matter what.",We do. Nobody lives forever.
Right.,"I mean I think, you want to look at say deaths as like the, “but for this disease, whatever, they would have lived X number of years.”"
Yeah.,"So, if somebody dies when they’re 20 and could have lived till 80, they lost 60 years. But if somebody dies when they’re 80 and they might’ve lived till 81 they lost one year."
Yes.,"So it’s, “How many life years were lost” is probably the right metric to use."
"I don’t read my own comments, but I do read other people’s comments. And I was reading this one little Twitter beef that was going on where someone was saying that COVID takes an average of 10 years off people’s lives and we should appreciate those 10 years. And then someone else said-",It’s not true.
I’m sure it’s not true.,Yeah definitely not.
"It’s the Twitter, it’s the world.",Oh my god.
But someone else said “The average age of people who die from COVID is older than the average age people die.”,"Let’s just say, it’s about the same."
"That’s a beautiful way of looking at it. I mean it’s unfortunate. It sucks, but it sucks if grandpa dies of Alzheimer’s or emphysema or leukemia. It sucks. It sucks when someone you love dies.","Yes. I mean actually, I think a lesson to be taken here that I think is quite important is that, if you have your grandparents and that they’re age of grandparents, really be careful with, any kind of flu or cold or something that that is not dangerous to kids or young adults, but is dangerous to the elderly. Basically, if your kid’s got a runny nose, they should stay away from their grandparents, no matter what it is. There’re things where a young immune system has no problem, an older one has a problem. In fact a lot of the deaths are literally, it’s tragic, but they’re, they’re intra-family. It’s, the little kid had a cold or flu and they [crosstalk 01:40:31]."
Give it to grandpa.,"Yeah. They had the family gathering. And they don’t know that this is a big deal. But it’s just important to remember when you get old, your immune system’s just not that strong. And so, just be careful with your loved ones who are elderly."
"And I think there is some true objective understanding of the immune system and the ways to boost that immune system. And I really think that information should be distributed in a way, a nonjudgmental way, but like, “Look, this is a scientifically proven way that we can boost our immune system and it might save your life and it might save the life of your loved ones.” And maybe we could teach this to our grandparents and our parents and people that are vulnerable, vitamin C, heat shock proteins, all these different variables that we know contribute to a stronger immune system.","Yeah. Actually, just a thing that is tough. As you get older, you tend to put on weight, certainly that’s happening with me. The older I get like, “Damn, sure harder to stay lean.” That’s for sure. And so, actually, being overweight is a big deal. It’s a fact. Yeah."
The New York hospital said it was the number one factor for severe COVID symptoms was obesity. That was the number one factor.,"That’s correct. It is, yes, exactly."
"But it’s also, we live in a world where people want to be sensitive to other people’s feelings.","Yeah, absolutely."
So they don’t want to bring up the fact that being fat’s bad for you. It’s a judgmental on your…,Food’s great.
I do love food.,"Yeah. I mean to be totally frank, I mean, speaking for myself, I’d rather read tasty food and live a shorter life."
Yeah. Those moments of enjoying a great meal.,Yeah.
"And then even talking about it, they’re valuable. They’re worth something. Yeah. We don’t want to eat Soylent Green and live to be 160.","No. Tasty food is great, it’s one of the best things about life."
It really is. Yeah. It’s an art form as well.,"Yeah, absolutely."
"It’s like fine food, it’s a delicious sandcastle. It’s temporary. It doesn’t last very long. But there’s something about it that’s very pleasing.","Yeah. I don’t know what advice to give, maybe having tasty food but smaller amounts of it."
"Yeah. And I think, regulated feeding windows, really the way to go, some sort of an intermittent fasting approach.",Sure.
"When I started doing that, I found myself to be quite a bit healthier. When I’ve deviated from that I’ve gained weight.",So what?
16 hours?,"Well Okay, yeah."
I like 16 hours. Yeah.,So like at night or at a certain [crosstalk 01:43:40]
"Yeah. So I get to a certain point and then I count out, I usually hit the stopwatch on my phone and then I look at 15 hours, and I’m like “Oh, okay. Got an hour before I can eat.”",Yeah.
And so anything in between that is just water or coffee.,"Actually, this may be a useful bit of advice for people, but eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep. And it can actually cause heartburn, that you don’t even know is happening, and that subtle heartburn, it affects your sleep because your horizontal and your body’s digesting. So if you want to improve the quality of your sleep and be healthier, it’s do not eat right before we go to sleep. It’s one of the worst things you could do."
"Some of the biggest mistakes I’ve ever made. I’ve done that, particularly after comedy shows, if I’m starving, I’ll come home and I’ll eat. And then I go to bed and I just feel like shit and I wake up in the middle of the night.","It’s going to crush your sleep and it’s going to damage your pyloric sphincter and your esophagus. In fact drinking and then going to sleep, that’s one of the worst things you could do."
Yes.,So just try to avoid drinking and eating-
"Booze, drinking booze.","Yeah, exactly. Small amounts of alcohol, evidence suggests it doesn’t have a negative effect on-"
I put it in the same category as delicious food. It kind of makes things a little more fun. I like it.,"Yeah. I mean some of the people who’ve lived the longest, there was a woman in France who I think, maybe has the record or close to it, and she had a glass of wine every day. Small amounts is fine. But yeah, I learned this like quite late in life. It’s like, just avoid having alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep, and your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot."
"For sure, yeah.","It’s a big deal and I think, not widely known."
Do you have time to exercise?,A little bit.
Do you have a trainer or anything?,"I do, although I haven’t seen him for a while. But yeah, especially if I’m out, say we’re working on Starship or something South Texas and I’m just living in my, I got a little house there in Boca Chica village, and I don’t have much to do, so. Or I’m working and I’ll just lift some weights or something. Some people love running, I don’t love running. But if-"
What do you like to do exercise wise?,"To be totally frank, I wouldn’t exercise at all if I could. I prefer not to exercise, but if I’m going to exercise, I’ll lift some weights and then kind of run on a treadmill and maybe watch a show, if there’s a compelling show that pulls you in."
"Right. Yeah. That’s a good thing to do. Watch a good movie or episode of Black Mirror or something like that, it’s great.","Man, don’t watch Black Mirror before going to bed either."
Well don’t watch Black Mirror today. It’s too fucking accurate.,"Yeah, exactly. It’s like, “Wait, that’s already happened in real life.”"
Yeah. They’re too close.,It’s too close.
"Yeah, he wants to hold off because reality-",He’s nailed it?
…is black mirror.,Oh man.
"It’s like he’s going to have to reassess and attack it from a different angle. you should try something that’s fun to do. That’s not just, like learn a martial art or something like that.",I did martial arts when I was kid. Liked it.
Did you? What’d you do?,"I did a TaeKwonDo. I did Karate, [foreign language 00:14:51] [crosstalk 01:47:52]."
"Oh, alright, cool.",And Judo.
"Oh, so you really branched out.",Yeah. And did Brazilian Jujitsu briefly.
Did you? Where?,In Palo Alto.
Really?,Yeah.
"Oh no shit. I was going to suggest that. That’s a great thing for people. That’s a thing about jujitsu, if you look at it from the outside you think, “Oh bunch of meatheads strangling each other.”",Sure.
"But they’re some of the smartest people I know, are jujitsu fiends because, first of all, they get introduced to it because usually either they want to exercise or learn some self-defense, but then they realize that it’s essentially like a language with your body. Like you’re having an argument with someone with some sort of a physical language. And it’s really complex and the more access to vocabulary and the sharper your words are, the more you’ll succeed in these ventures. That’s really an accurate analogy of what jujitsu is.","Yeah. I mean, I kind of got, probably like a lot of people, for the way-early day, the first MMA fights and Royce Gracie, and he was just like incredible. And it was like-"
Technique.,"Yeah. He was winning against people way bigger and that kind of thing. And it was just like “Whoa, this is cool.”"
"It was what martial arts were supposed to be, when we were kids. When you saw Bruce Lee fuck-up all these big giant guys. Like, “Wow, martial arts allow you to beat someone far bigger and stronger than you.”",Right.
Most of the time that’s not real.,"Especially if they know martial arts too. It’s like, “Oh no.”"
"Yes. But in the UFC, when Royce Gracie, off of his back, was strangling Dan Severn with his legs. You’re like, “Holy shit, this guy’s being pinned by this big giant wrestler, and he wraps his legs around his neck, and chokes him to the point that guy has to surrender.” Amazing.","Yeah, it was amazing. I mean Royce got beaten up pretty bad in some of those."
"Well, he definitely had some rough fights-",But he won.
"He won. Yeah. He’s a legend. But what it showed, I mean I’m a huge lover of jujitsu, what it showed is that there is a method for diffusing these situations with technique and knowledge. And I think it’s also a great way to exercise too because it’s almost like the exercise is secondary to the learning of the thing. The exercise is like you want to develop strength and conditioning just so that you could be better at doing the thing. And the analogy that I use is, imagine if you had a race car and you could actually give the race car better handling and more horsepower just from your own focus and effort. That’s really what it’s like.","Yeah, totally."
Yeah. When am I going to be able to-,"My kids… I should say, I sent my kids to jujitsu since they were like, I don’t know, six."
"Oh, really?",Yeah.
"Oh, that’s awesome.",[crosstalk 01:50:51]. Yeah.
It’s a great thing to learn. It really is.,"Yes, seems like a good… Yeah."
"Yeah. Maybe something like… mean even if you just have someone who holds the pads for you, you could get a workout in and it’d be fun.",Sure.
When am I going to be able to buy one of them roadsters? When’s that happening?,"Well I can’t say exactly when, but we got to get it… This COVID thing’s kind of thrown us for a loop."
I’m sure.,"So, not to blame everything on COVID, but it’s certainly set us back on progress for some number of months. But I mean things were going to get done. Ahead of Roadster are, ramping up model Y production, that’ll be a great car, it is a great car, getting the Berlin Giga-factory built, and also building Y getting expanding the Shanghai factory, which is going great and get this Cybertruck, Semi truck, Roadster. Roadster is kind of like dessert. We gotta get the meat and potatoes and greens and stuff."
But Roadster comes before cyber truck?,"I mean, I think we should do Cybertruck first, before Roadster."
Interesting.,Now some of the-
I’m not mad at that.,"Some of the things for Roadster, the tri-motor, plaid powertrain, we’re going to have that in model S. So that’s like part one of the ingredients that’s needed for Roadster, is the plaid powertrain, the more advanced battery pack. That kind of thing."
I wanted to ask you about this before I forgot. There’s a company that’s called Apex is taking your Teslas and they’re giving it a wider base and wider tires and a little bit more advanced suspension.,Sure.
How do you feel about that?,"Sounds good to me, sure."
Do you work with them? Are you cool with those people?,"Yeah, I mean, go ahead."
They’re jazzing stuff up with carbon fiber and doing a bunch of interior choices. You’re cool with… You can’t fuck with that. You don’t have time. So is it good that someone comes along and has that sort of specialty operation?,Yeah. I’ve got no problem.
That’s right. Unplugged Performance. Yeah.,"Yeah. You could for sure, lighten the car up and improve tire traction and-"
Have you seen that company’s stuff? What they do?,"I don’t know specifically, but there’s-"
"It’s pretty dope. They make it pretty dope looking… They take model S and they widen it and give it a bunch of carbon fiber. That’s it, right there.",Cool.
"Ooh-la-la, look at that.",That looks pretty nice.
"Yeah, it does. Now, the plaid version of the model S, are you going to widen the track and do a bunch of different, I know you guys are testing at the Nurburgring. Can you not talk about that?","Well, I think we’ve got to leave that for a proper sort of product unveil."
I understand.,Yeah.
I understand. Last time you were here you convince me to buy a Tesla. I bought it and it’s fucking insane.,Oh great. Glad you like it.
Aw Man.,Pretty fun.
"I don’t… It’s not just pretty fun. The way I’ve described it is, it makes other cars seem stupid. They just seem dumb. And I love dumb things. I love dumb cars. Like I love campfires. I love campfires. I have a 1993 Porsche that’s air cooled.",Sure.
It’s not that fast. It’s really slow compared to the Tesla really.,"Yeah, actually, it’s really quite slow. But, okay, sure."
"But there’s something engaging about the mechanical, just like the gears and, it’s very analog. But it’s so stupid in comparison to the Tesla. Like when I want to go somewhere in the model S, I hit the gas and it just goes, whee. It just, it like violates time.",Yeah.
Yeah.,You’ve tried it like Ludicrous Plus and stuff like that?
Oh yeah.,Yeah. Cool.
Yeah. Oh yeah.,"We just did a software update where it’ll do, like a, cheetah stance. So yeah. So, because it’s got a dynamic air suspension so it lowers the back."
Oh Jesus.,Just like a sprinter basically.
Right.,"Like what do you do if you’re a sprinter, you hunker down and then shoo. So I shaved like a 10th of a second off the 0 to 60. I mean it’s pretty fun."
"It’s so… I’ve taken so many people. And, I take them for the Holy shit moment. I’m like, “You ready?” like “Hang on there.” and then I stomp on the gas-",And they’ve never felt anything like it.
It’s confusing.,Yeah.
It really is.,Sure.
The instant torque and just the sheer acceleration is baffling.,It’s baffling.
It’s baffling.,They’ve never felt it.
No.,It’s faster than falling.
"It’s crazy. It’s so fast. It’s a roller coaster. And my family yells at me when I stomp the gas. Like I tell my kids, I’m like, “You want to feel it? You want to feel it?” they’re like “Do it, do it, do it.” my wife’s like, “Don’t do it.” Boom. And even if I just do it on the highway for a couple of seconds, it’s very exciting.","Yeah, pretty fun."
It’s very fun.,Yeah. It’s like having your own roller coaster on tap.
"It really is like a roller coaster on tap. Without the loop de loops. But, the pinning to your seat, it seems like you’re not supposed to be able to experience that from some sort of a consumer vehicle that a regular person could buy, if you have the money. It seems too crazy. And then the idea that this Roadster is a half of a second faster than that? That’s madness.","Well with a Roadster, we’re going to do some things that are kind of unfair. So we’re going to take some things from Cadillac rocket world and put them on a car, so."
"Oh, I’ve read about that. Explain that. Like what do you?","Well, like I said, we can’t do the product unveil right here. But, it’s going to do some things that are unfair."
Unfair.,"When we do the unveil of the Roadster, let me just say that anyone who’s been waiting, they won’t be sorry. They won’t be sorry."
"Oh, but sure, well anything that goes 0 to 60, what is it 1.9? Is that the 0 to 60?",That’s the base model.
What’s the top of the food chain model?,[inaudible 00:01:57:14].
Okay. Faster than that. Let’s just say faster than that.,"Faster than that, yeah."
"That seems so crazy to me. Now, what was it like when the dude threw the steel balls at the window and they were supposed to not break, and it broke?","Well, yeah. I mean-"
"I know, extenuating circumstances.","…at least you know that our demos are authentic, because I was not expecting that and then I think I muttered, under my breath, like “Holy shit”."
Yeah. You didn’t get mad though.,No-
You didn’t Steve jobs it.,"No, I definitely swore, I didn’t think the micro pick it up but it did. But, so like we practiced this, behind the scenes. At Tesla, we don’t do like tons of practice for our demos, because we’re working on the cars. We’re building new technologies and improving the fundamental product. So we’re not spending, doing hundreds of practice things or anything like that. We don’t have time for that. But, just hours before the demo, both Franz, head of design and I were in the studio throwing steel balls at the window, and it’s bouncing right off. And like, “Okay, this seems pretty good. It seems like we got it.” Okay? And then, we think what happened was, when Franz hit the door with the sledgehammer-"
"Oh, yeah.","…show, this is exoskeleton, high strength, hardened steel. You can literally wind up with a sledgehammer, full on double-handed sledgehammer and hit the door and there’s not even a dent. It’s cool. But we think that cracked the corner of the glass at the bottom and then, once you crack the corner of the glass it’s game over. So then when you threw the ball that’s what cracked the glass."
So in hindsight-,It didn’t go through though.
It didn’t go through.,It’s doesn’t go through.
"That’s true. It didn’t shatter the whole thing, like a regular window would either, which would just dissolve. Right? So in hindsight, the ball should have been first, sledgehammer second.",Yeah.
"You live, you learn.","Yeah, exactly."
"Listen, man, we’ve taken up a lot of your time. You had a child recently.","Yeah, I got to get back to it."
"It’s amazing that you had the time to come down here. And I really appreciate that. I appreciate everything you do, man. I’m glad you’re out there. And I really appreciate you coming down here and sharing your perspective.","Well, I think you’ve got a great show. Thanks for having me on."
Thank you. My pleasure.,All right.
"Elon Musk, ladies and gentlemen. Good night.","Anyway, that should get a little play."
"It doesn’t look like anything else. So we’ll start off with the size, the dimensions. And the inspiration. So the functionality I’m going to describe is within a space that is less than the most popular pickup truck in the United States, the F150. So we didn’t cheat in either width, height, or length, and we’re able to achieve much greater capability in the same dimensions, same weight. Yeah. Part of this is the fundamental design change, we moved the mass to the outside. We created an exoskeleton.","So normally the way that a truck is designed, you have a body on frame, you have a bed on frame and the body and the bed don’t do anything useful. They’re carried like cargo, like a sack of potatoes. It was the way that aircraft used to be designed, when they had biplanes, basically. The key to creating an effective monoplane was a stressed skin design. You move the stress to the outside skin. Allows you to do things that you can’t do with a body on frame. So we’re able to make the skin out of thick, ultra hard stainless steel. It’s really hard. We’re going to show you just how hard."

Do it Franz!,It’s a regular truck door.
Want me to do this?,Do it.
That’s some pretty hard stuff.,"Yeah, hit it a couple times."
Want me to hit it again? All right.,"Yeah, nice. Now hit the Cybertruck. Same thing. Hit it harder. Yeah. Really wind up and nail it."
It’s pretty strong.,"Very strong. So if you think about a truck, you want a truck that’s tough. You want a truck that’s really tough, not fake tough. You want a truck you can take a sledgehammer to. A truck that won’t scratch. It doesn’t dent. What else can we do with this truck? What if we shot it? Let’s shoot it."
Shoot it!,"But OSHA, I mean, come on. That’s a 9mm bullet shot at the door."
Shoot it!,"We’re in California, unfortunately. But the 9mm… It is literally bulletproof to a 9mm handgun. That’s how strong the skin is. So it’s ultra hard, cold rolled stainless steel alloy that we’ve developed. We’re going to be using the same alloy in the Starship rocket and in the Cybertruck."
Take my money!,"Yeah, you’re welcome. So on the right, that’s like normal truck doors that may as well be made of tissue paper. That looks like a paintball. Very different. So when you say something’s built tough, that’s what we mean."
"Yeah, you’re welcome. So on the right, that’s like normal truck doors that may as well be made of tissue paper. That looks like a paintball. Very different. So when you say something’s built tough, that’s what we mean.",What about the glass?
Love you Elon!,Seems like a vulnerability.
Bulletproof!,"Yeah, transparent metal glass. Yeah, that’s right. Let’s show some of the tests. What can we do with this?"
Shoot it!,"All right. Let’s show the glass demo. There you go. So first this is regular glass. This is like normal glass, car glass. We’re going to show you what happens with normal car glass. Shatters immediately, with the little ball. Now we’ll show you Tesla armored glass. Nothing. Yeah, it’s kind of a small ball though. Let’s maybe do it at a bigger height with a… Yeah. Yeah."
Drop it.,"[inaudible 00:06:55] Yeah, not bad. A bigger ball. Yeah. Not bad. Franz, could you try to break this glass please?"
Sure?,"Yeah. Oh my f***ing God. Well, maybe that was a little too hard."
Yeah. Should we try on the rear?,"[inaudible 00:08:08] It didn’t go through, as a plus side."
Let’s try the rear.,"Try that one? Really? Okay. Sure. Aw, man. It didn’t go through. All right."
Major league contract…,"Not bad. Room for improvement. All right. Let’s see. So yeah. We didn’t actually throw everything… We threw wrenches, we threw everything. We even literally threw the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn’t break. For some weird reason it broke now. I don’t know why. Fix it in post."

We even literally threw the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn’t break. For some weird reason it broke now. I don’t know why. Fix it in post.","In addition, the car has an adaptive air suspension. It’s literally built… Yeah, with adaptive air suspension. So this will come standard on all the cars. I think this is actually a very important design element because if you have a… If every truck has the ability to adjust the ride height so you can go very low or very high, so you can be efficient on the highway and you can also go off-roading. It’s going to have the highest clearance of any production truck. So it would have about a 16 inch clearance. And you can adjust this on the fly. So it’s adaptive damping and adaptive ride height. These are actually extremely important for a truck. Because trucks when you only drive them, they’re either too cushy or they’re too hard. You need it to be able to adjust dynamically depending upon what the load is. If you’ve got a lot of people on board, if you’ve got a full bed in the back, it’s got to adjust accordingly."

Let’s look… Let’s demo this active. Yeah. The rear is a hundred cubic feet, six and a half foot length, bed length, up to 3,500 pounds of payload. Yeah. And it can tow… But what about a real world test? Let’s actually have a tug of war here with an F150. So you can see which one can pull which. Let’s do the tug of war video. I mean, yeah. It was uphill."

Wow.,"Now let’s see, how does this compare to a Porsche 911? Okay, we’re going to give the Porsche a little bit of a headstart. Yeah. This is a current edition Porsche. And this is the actual truck. This is not CGI. In terms of off road performance, it’s going to have the best angular approach angle, best clearance heights, best departure angle. For people that are really going off road, this is going to be great. You could basically do the Baja Rally in this thing."

So obviously it’ll have access to all the superchargers, be capable of more than 250 kilowatts, we’ll reveal the actual number later, and it has onboard outlets for 110 and 220 volts. So you don’t need a generator. The truck literally is your generator. And, as a little plus, because it’s got an air suspension, we can tap off the air suspension so you have a pneumatic source. So you have an… Yeah. Onboard air compressor. Of course it will come with autopilot standard. Yep."

But it’s going to… [crosstalk 00:13:48] That’s the price without any incentives. That’s just like the price without any incentives. But the actual economics are even better than that because the cost of electricity is much less than the cost of gasoline. So when you look at the actual cost of ownership here, it’s… You’re paying much less for electricity than you are for the gasoline. You’re paying much less for maintenance. There’s no oil changes, no smog checks, no nothing, none of that stuff. So your maintenance is low, your cost of operations are low. And so it’s actually comparable to a truck, a gasoline truck, that’s 10 to $15,000 less. Yeah."

Thank you Elon!,"It’s going to be a great party and you’ll love riding around in this thing. It’s great. All right, thank you. Oh wait. We have…"
One more thing!,"Should we do the… Oh yeah. We also made an ATV, so… Let’s bring it out."
No way! [crosstalk 00:16:30],"So you can see the truck. This is what I mean by the adaptive air suspension. Nice work, by the way. So the adaptive air suspension, you can drop real low and go high on the other side with [inaudible 00:17:19] load mode. So you’ve got load mode, you’ve got a built-in ramp. You can take a ATV or dirt bike, whatever you want, and load it on the back."
And it’s charging.,"Yes. Oh, and it’s currently plugged in and charging."
No way!,"Yeah. If you look, the car is adjusting itself. So you can go like real tight on the freeway and you’re going to go way high off-roading. Yeah."
Thank you.,All right. Thank you.
"Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Tesla, Second Quarter, 2021 Q&A Webcast. I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn, and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 1:00 PM Pacific time in the update deck we published at the same link as these webcasts. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events and results could differ materially and due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question and answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Please press star one now if you would like to join the question queue, but before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon.","Sure. So to recap, Q2, 2021 was the record quarter on many levels. We achieved record production [inaudible 00:01:35] , and surpassed over a billion dollars and gap income for the first time in Tesla history. I’d really like to congratulate everyone at Tesla for an amazing job. This is really an incredible milestone. It also seems that public sentiment towards Ev’s is at an inflection point. And this point, I think almost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward. Regarding supply chain, while we’re making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious. For the rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest parts in our supply chain, which is there’s a wide range of chips that are at various times the slowest parts of the supply chain. I mean, it’s worth noting that if we had everything else, if we had vast numbers of vehicles in sales, we were not able to make them, if everything except the chips, we would be able to make them. The chips supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output. It’s difficult for us to say how long this will last because we don’t have, this is because out of our control, essentially. It does seem like it’s getting better, but it’s hard to predict. So in fact, even achieving the output that we did achieve was only due to an immense effort from people within Tesla. We were able to substitute alternative chips and then write the firmware in a matter of weeks. It’s not just a matter of swapping out a chip. You also have to rewrite the software. So it was an incredibly intense effort of finding new chips, writing new firmware, integrating with the vehicle and testing in order to maintain production. And I also like to thank our suppliers who worked with us and there’ve been many calls, midnight, 1:00 AM just with suppliers, in resolving a lot of the shortages. So thanks very much to our suppliers."

Obviously we need to have the full self-driving [inaudible 00:04:14] widely available for it really to take off at a high rate. And we’re making a lot of progress there.

So we’re in the factory right now doing this earnings call. And the team has made incredible progress here. You can see the pictures online and see that there’s basically nothing a year ago and this mostly complete large factory a year later. So really, really great work by the Giga, Texas team. And then also great work in Berlin- Brandenburg with the team there. So we expect to be producing the sort of new design of the Model Y in both factories in limited production later this year. It’s always like, it’s hard to sort of explain to people who have not been through the agony of a manufacturing ramp. Like, why can’t you just turn it on and make 5,000 a week. This is, it is so hard to do manufacturing. It is so hard to do production. First approximation, there are thousand unique parts and processes that have to work. And the greater growth of production goes as fast as the least lucky and dumbest of those 10,000 things."

I’m fond of saying that prototypes are easy and production is hard. And I do believe that the really remarkable thing that Tesla’s done, it’s not to make an electric car or to be a car startup because there’ve been hundreds of car startups in the United States and outside United States. So the thing that’s remarkable is that Tesla didn’t go bankrupt in reaching volume production. That’s the amazing part because everyone else did because they all thought the prototype or the idea was the hard part, and it is not. It is trivial by comparison with actual production. So it’s always worth noting that of all the American car companies, there are only two that have not gone bankrupt, and that is Ford and Tesla. So, the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory. And we must be careful that we cannot do that. They often, if you look at the look at history, so often at the Caesar’s feet are set on the day of victory. We will endeavor not to make that the case at Tesla."

The Model Y is in Texas and made Texas, and Berlin will look very much like the Model Y’s we currently make, but that there are substantial improvements in the difficulty of manufacturing. So for example, the Model Y made here and in Berlin will have a cast front body and a cast rear body. Whereas the one in California has cast rear body, but not a cast front body. We’re also aiming to do a structural pack with 4680 cells, which is a mass reduction and a cost reduction. But we’re not counting on that as the only way to make things work. We have some backup plans with a non-structural pack and 2170, essentially. So, but at scale production, we obviously want to be using 4680’s and structural pack. From a physics standpoint, this is the best architecture. And from an economic standpoint, it is the lowest cost way to go. So the lightest, lowest cost, but there’s a lot of new technology there. So it’s difficult predict with precision. When does it work and when do you reach the scale production. Andrew’s going to talk a bit more about the 4680 productions."

So we are making great progress in 4680 cells, but there is a tremendous amount of innovation that we’re packing into that 4680 cell. And so it’s not simply a sort of minor improvements on state of the art. There are… And we went through this on the factory sell date, really dozens of, half a dozen major improvements and dozens of small improvements. So I think it will be great, but it’s [inaudible 00:09:43] to say when the last of the technical challenges will be solved."

We have had some factory shutdowns due to a power shortages, and we hope those will be relieved in the coming weeks and months. And we’re making great progress on self driving. So far this is not easy to see because of, at the foundational software level. And so it ends up being sort of a two steps forward, one step back situation, and, but over time, if you do two steps forward, one step back and keep going, you do move forward. So I’m highly confident that the cars will be capable of full self-driving if they full self-driving computer and the cameras, I’m confident that they will be able to drive themselves with the safety levels substantially greater than that of the average post. But again, thanks to all of our employees who are making this a breakthrough year for Tesla and an incredible quarter. Thanks, guys."
"Sorry, we cut out there for a second. Yeah. The Cybertruck is currently in its alpha stages. We finished basic engineering architecture of the vehicle. With the Cybertruck we’re redefining how the vehicle is being made. As Elon said, it carries much of the structural pack and large casting designs of the model Y being built in Berlin and Austin. Obviously those take priority over the Cybertruck, but we are moving into the beta phases of Cybertruck later this year. And we’ll be looking to ramp that in production in [inaudible 00:15:34] Texas after model Y is up and going.","Yeah. I just want to reemphasize the extraordinary difficulty of ramping production of large manufactured items. At risk of being repetitive, it’s actually easy to make prototypes or sort of handle small volume production, but anything produced at high volume, which is really what’s relevant here, it’s going to move as fast as the slowest of the, say rough order of magnitude, 10,000 unique parts and processes. And so you can have 9,999, where just one is missing. We were missing, for example, a big struggle this quarter was the module that controls the airbags and the seatbelts. And obviously you cannot strip a car without those. And that limited our production severely worldwide, in Shanghai and in Fremont. So it wouldn’t have mattered if we had 17 different car models, because they all need the airbag module. It’s just irrelevant."

It’s just irrelevant.","So in order for Cybertruck and Semi to scale to volume that’s meaningful for customer deliveries, we’ve got to solve the chip shortage, or working with our suppliers. People sometimes say, why don’t you just build a chip vat? Okay. Well, okay. That would take us, even moving like lightening, 12 to 18 months. So it’s not like you can just whip up a chip vat. It’s just like, yeah, just make a quick chip vat."

I think it may be the case that Tesla is scaling. I think we might be the fastest in history ever for scaling a large manufactured object. Maybe the Model T would have been comparable back in the day of the Ford Model T. Probably internet knows the answer, but I think we may be scaling large manufactured objects at the fastest rate in history, or I’d like to know who did it faster so we can learn from them."

So, yeah. So the Cybertruck and Semi actually both are heavy users of sub capacity, so we’ve got to make sure we have the sub capacity for those two vehicles or it’s kind of pointless. We can make a small number of vehicles, but the effective cost, if you make a small number of vehicles, is insane. They would literally cost a million dollars piece or more. There’s a reason why you do things at volume production, which is to get the economies of scale that get the cost down."

But even without Tesla … (silence)."
"So we are looking at a pretty massive increase in cell availability next year, but it’s not like in January one, it comes through … it ramps up through the course of next year. But even without Tesla … (silence).","Hello? Even without Tesla’s cell production, our suppliers will be able to deliver about twice as much cell output in next year as this year. [inaudible 00:19:51], do you want to talk more about that?"
"Yeah. Given concerns over cell’s bottlenecking growth, our target is to grow cell supply ahead of the 50% year on year growth targets of the vehicle business and also enable increased energy storage deployments. So yeah, our cells suppliers are tracking to double their production in 2022.","Yeah. It’s worth noting. If you have a target of a certain number, that doesn’t mean it happens as sure as night follows day. It’s a target. So if there is some calamity in the world that interrupts the supply chain, then it will be less. But the contracts that we have with cell suppliers, roughly a doubling of cell supply to Tesla in 2022. And we have to joggle these exponential … it’s whole bunch of exponential graphs, sort of overlayed on top of each other. And small changes in where you are on the X axis of time can quite substantially change the area under the code. So what we’re thinking of doing is, depending on if … It’s basically overshooting on cell supply for vehicles, and then, as we have, say excess cell supply in one month or another, then routing that cell’s outputs to the Megapack and Powerwall. [inaudible 00:21:30] if we’re prioritizing vehicle production, if there’s a shortage of cell output for some reason, then we will throttle down Megapack and Powerwall production. But something’s got to give basically."
"Or if there’s a disruption in the vehicle production, then you have an outlet for the cell capacity.","Yes, exactly. There’s a tremendous amount of inertia in the supply chain. So if we say to a supplier, we want you to double cell output. Well, even doing that in a year is very difficult. And then that system has a tremendous amount of momentum. It is like a flotilla of supertankers. It’s insane."
"Speaking of which, from a raw materials perspective, we also have long-term contracts to secure our supply chain to also enable this growth. So we’re not just looking at the suppliers, but upstream from there. Which is more flotillas.","Yeah. As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest parts of the entire supply chain, which goes all the way back to raw materials, lithium and nickel and that kind of thing. And there’s sometimes misperception that Tesla uses a lot of cobalt, but we actually don’t. Apple uses, I think almost 100% cobalt in their batteries and cell phones and laptops, but Tesla uses no cobalt in the iron phosphate packs and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries."

Apple uses, I think almost 100% cobalt in their batteries and cell phones and laptops, but Tesla uses no cobalt in the iron phosphate packs and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries.","So on a weighted average basis, we might use 2% cobalt compared to Apple’s 100% cobalt. Anyway. So it’s really just not a factor. We expect to basically have zero cobalt in the future. I think probably there is a long-term shift, more in the direction of iron-based lithium-ion cells over nickel. As the energy density of sort of iron or iron phosphate, but might as well just call it iron, the phosphate is taken for granted. But iron-based cells, lithium-ion cells, and nickel-based lithium-ion cells, I think probably we’ll see a shift, my guess is probably to two-thirds iron, one-third nickel or something on that order."

And there’s way less cobalt. So it is good for relieving the long-term scaling to move to iron-based cells mostly. And I think long-term, possibly all … There’s a good chance that all stationary storage that is Powerwall and Megapack moves to iron. It seems most likely the case since you do not need to transport it. And there’s less of volume capacity constraint for stationary storage. So then nickel would be for, really for long range road transport, ships and aircraft and that kind of thing."
"Thank you. Let’s go to the second question from retail, which is, Elon has said that Tesla will be opening up the supercharger network to other EVs later this year. Can you share some more details on how this will be structured? Will this be select brands, or will they contribute to the growth of this network?","Yes, we’re currently thinking it’s a real simple thing where you just download the Tesla app and you go to a supercharger and you just indicate which stall you’re in. So you plug in your power, even if it’s not Tesla, and then you just access the app and say, turn on the stall that I’m in for how much electricity. And this should basically work with almost any manufacturer’s cars. There will be a time constraint. So if the charge rate is super slow, then somebody will be charged more. Because the biggest constraint at the superchargers is time. How occupied is the stall?"
"Yes, we’re currently thinking it’s a real simple thing where you just download the Tesla app and you go to a supercharger and you just indicate which stall you’re in.

And this should basically work with almost any manufacturer’s cars. There will be a time constraint. So if the charge rate is super slow, then somebody will be charged more. Because the biggest constraint at the superchargers is time. How occupied is the stall?","And we’ll also be smarter with how we charge for electricity at the superchargers. So rush hour charging will be more expensive than off-hours charging, because there are times when the superchargers are empty and times when they’re jam packed. And so it makes sense to have some time-based discrimination on them."
"Yeah. We’ve been doing that, and it’s been working and people respond. It helps with utilization.","Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, I think we’re … In Europe and China and most parts of the world, it’s the same connector for everyone. So this is a fairly easy thing to do, developed our own connector, which in my opinion is actually the best connector. It’s small and light and looks good as a standard. So we developed our own connector, which in my opinion, is actually the best connector because it’s small and light and looks good."

So we developed our own connector, which in my opinion, is actually the best connector because it’s small and light and looks good.","So an adapter is needed to work for EVs in North America, but people can buy this adapter and we anticipate having it available at the superchargers as well. If people don’t sort of steal them or something."
We have a good solution for that one.,"Okay. So that’s a constraint on the North American thing. That’s basically a vestige of history. But I think we do want to emphasize that our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy. It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors, which is sometimes used by some companies."
"I think it’s also important to comment that increasing the utilization of the network actually reduces our costs, which allows us to lower charging prices for all customers, makes the network more profitable, allows us to grow the network faster. That’s a good thing there. And no matter what, we’re going to continue to aggressively expand the network capacity, increasing charging speeds, improving the trip planning tools to protect against site congestion, using dynamic pricing, as Elon mentioned. And just continue to focus on minimum wait time for all customers.","Yeah. Obviously in order for superchargers to be useful to other car companies, as far as we need to grow the network faster than we’re growing vehicle output, which is not easy. We’re growing vehicle output at a hell of a rate. So superchargers needs to grow faster than vehicle output. So this is a lot of work for the supercharger team, but it is only useful, in the grand scheme of things, it’s only useful to the public if we’re able to grow faster than Tesla’s vehicle output. That is our goal."
"Thank you very much. And the third question is, Elon said 4680 cells aren’t reliable enough for vehicles. Is this referring to cycle life degradation or something else? Please update us on progress of 4680s and what still needs to be done to make them reliable enough for vehicles.","Yeah, really this is not … We’ll definitely make the 4680 reliable enough for vehicles. And we, I think, are at the point where, in limited volume, it is reliable enough for vehicles. Again, going back to limited production is easy or prototype production is easy, but high volume production is hard. There are a number of challenges in transitioning from …"

There are a number of challenges in transitioning from …","There are a number of challenges in transitioning from a small scale production to a large volume production. Not to get too much into the weeds of things, but right now we have a challenge with basically what’s called calendaring, or basically squashing the cathode with material to a particular height. It just goes through these rollers and gets squashed like pizza dough basically. But very hard pizza dough and it’s damaging the calendar rolls."
"There are a number of challenges in transitioning from a small scale production to a large volume production.

It just goes through these rollers and gets squashed like pizza dough basically. But very hard pizza dough and it’s damaging the calendar rolls.","This is not something that happened when the calendar rolls were smaller, but it is happening when the calendar rolls are bigger. We weren’t expecting that."
"It’s not a science problem. It’s an engineering problem. It’s a question of if, it’s a question of when, and the team is a hundred percent focused on resolving these limiting processes as quickly as possible.",Exactly.
"On the reliability side, as Elon mentioned, we have successfully validated performance and the lifetime durability of the 4680 cells produced with Cato, and we’re continuing ongoing verification of that reliability. We’re actually accruing over one million equivalent miles on our cells that we produce every month in our testing activities. The focus on that is very clear. We want high quality cells for all of our customers. We’re just focused on the unlucky limiting steps in the facility, and with the engineer’s focused on those few steps remaining, we’re going to breakthrough as fast as possible.","Meantime, we have a massive amount of equipment on order and arriving for the high volume self production in Austin and Berlin. Obviously, given what we’ve learned with the pilot plant, which is in Fremont, which is really quite a big plant by most standards, we will have to modify a bunch of that equipment. So it won’t be able to start immediately, but it seems like, Drew correct me if I’m wrong, but we think most likely we will hit an annualized rate of 100 gigawatt hours a year sometime next year."
"We’ll have all the equipment installed to accomplish a hundred gigawatt hours. It’s possible that by the end of the year, we will be at an annualized rate of a hundred gigawatt hours. By the end of the year.","I mean, my guess is, more likely than not, above 50% of reaching a hundred gigawatt hours a year by the end of next year on annualized rate. Something like that."
"I mean, my guess is, more likely than not, above 50% of reaching a hundred gigawatt hours a year by the end of next year on annualized rate. Something like that.","It could shift by a little bit. But, as Drew said, it’s nothing fundamental. Just a lot of work."
All right. Thank you very much. The last question from retail is from Emmett. Can Elon do an interview with one of our YouTube channels once or twice a year. I would nominate David Leon Investing or [inaudible 00:34:03] Tesla Daily channels as first possible candidates.,"Yeah. I guess, I’ll do an interview. I mean, [inaudible 00:34:21], if I’m doing interviews, I can’t do actual other work. So it’s not, there’s only so much time in the day. But yeah, I’ll do it once. I wouldn’t do it annually, but I’ll do it once. I think, also, this is, I would say, the last time I’ll do earnings calls. I will no longer be default doing earnings calls. Obviously, I’ll do the annual shareholder meeting, but I think going forward, I will most likely not be on earnings calls unless there’s something really important that I need to say."
"Okay, thank you. Now let’s go through these additional questions. The first one, and we covered a lot of these already, can you please update us on timelines for the start of production of Berlin and Austin Model Y Cyber Track into semi? Do you expect the ramp of Cyber Track to be as difficult as it is a new process?","I think Cyber Track ramp will be difficult because it’s such a new architecture. It’s going to be a great product. It might be our best product ever, but there’s a lot of fundamentally new design ideas inside of a truck. Nobody’s ever really made a car like this before, a vehicle like this before. So, there’ll probably be challenges because there’s so much unexplored territory."
"Thank you. I think question two and question three we can skip given we have already addressed it. I’ll get the question four. In five years time, how much faster, better could you be at manufacturing capacity expansion using cut and paste, and what are the biggest issues you need to solve to get to that rate?","Right. Well, like I said, I think we might be the fastest growing company in history for any launched, manufactured item. Those who have not actually been involved with manufacturing ramp up have just no idea how painful and difficult it is. It’s like, you got to eat a lot of glass and for our manufacturing ramp, it’s hard."
"Yeah. I think if you look at the expansion we’ve done in Shanghai, that factory was built in less than a year and ramped in five to six months to full volume.","That took longer than that, about a year."
"When you consider cut and paste, we’ve repeated that in Fremont and whatever, but now with Berlin and Austin, we have new factories and new designs. There’s always challenges, as you said Elon, with new designs and ramping that. But I think having teams in three locations, or three continents, will definitely expand our ability and our capacity to grow more lines rather than just having the one factory in Fremont that we had and year and a half ago.","Yeah. For Shanghai, it was incredible that we obtained both those factories in 11 months, but it took longer building the factory. It took longer than that to actually reach volume production, high volume production. It took about a year. When you put a factory in a new geography, in order for that factory to be efficient, you have to localize the supply chain. There’s no such thing as cut and paste. It does not exist. It would obviously be insane to do vehicle production in Europe, but send vast numbers of parts from North America. That would make producing in Europe, for example, just crazy."

It’s supply chains where you go three or four layers deep. Frankly, I feel at times that we are inheriting old force majure of Earth. So, if anything goes wrong anywhere on Earth, something happens to mess up a supply chain."
"I think the human capital, the human capital growth though, of having factories here, Berlin, Shanghai, Fremont does a lot to maybe not exponentially grow, but hopefully exponentially grow.",We are exponentially growing.
Hopefully maintain that exponential growth.,"Also, it takes a while to hire old people and train old people to operate the factory. The factory is like giant cybernetic collective, and you can’t just hire 10,000 people and have it work instantly. It is simply not possible."
"Also, it takes a while to hire old people and train old people to operate the factory. The factory is like giant cybernetic collective, and you can’t just hire 10,000 people and have it work instantly.

This has just not been an area where all that many smart people have gone into. I think US has an over allocation of talent in finance and law. It’s both a criticism and a compliment. I’m not saying we shouldn’t have people in finance and law. I’m just saying maybe we have too many smart people in those areas. Maybe."
Manufacturing is fun.,Yeah. Manufacturing is great. It’s a very interesting problem. Obviously you can’t have stuff unless someone makes it. That’s how you gets stuff.
Okay. Thank you very much. Let’s go through the last investor question. Does Tesla plan to offer more services beyond FSD or high-speed connectivity as part of its subscription bundle going forward? What areas in particular present an opportunity?,"We don’t have a lot of ideas on this to be frank. Really full self-driving is the main thing. Things are obviously headed towards fully autonomous electric vehicle future. I think Tesla is well positioned, and frankly is the leader objectively, in both of those arenas, electrification and autonomy. It’s always tempting to try to find analogies, with other companies, whatever, but really the value of a fully electric autonomous fleet is it’s going to be gigantic, boggles the mind really. That will be one of the most valuable things that is ever done in the history of civilization."
"Thanks so much, guys. Can you speak to the attach rates for FSD so far, and where you’re targeting in terms of the subscription levels?","It’s not worth commenting on right now. It’s not meaningful. We really need full self-driving, at least the beta, to be widely available so that anyone who wants it can get it. Otherwise, it would be pointless to read anything into where things are right now."
"Okay. Then just to follow up there, is about the cadence of the regulatory environment keeping up with the technology. Are you seeing meaningful evolution in terms of the regulators really understanding the technology and beginning to set some standards here sometime in the near term?","At least in the US, we don’t see regulation as the fundamental limiter. We’ve also got to make it work, and then demonstrate that the reliability is significantly in excess of the average human driver for to be allowed, for people to be able to use it without paying attention to the road."

It will be, I think, straight forward to make the arguments on statistical grounds, just based on the number of interventions, especially in events that would result in a crash. At scale, we think we’ll have millions of miles of travel to be able to show that the safety of the car with auto pilot on is a hundred percent or 200% or more safer than the average human driver."

It would be like-"
"At that point, I think it would be unconscionable not to allow auto pilot, because the car just becomes way less safe. It would be like-","Because the car becomes way less safe. Shake the elevator analogy. Back in the day, you used to have elevator operators with a big sort of switch to operate the elevator and move between floors. But, they get tired or maybe drunk or something or distracted. And every now and again, somebody would be kind of sheared in half between floors. That’s kind of the situation we have with cars."

And today, we were just getting in an elevator, we pressed the button for which Lori wanted, and it just takes us there safely. It would be quite alarming if elevators operated by a person with a giant switch. That’s how it will be with cars."
"Hi everybody. Your costs of goods sold per vehicles are already down to the mid $37,000 range in the quarter. It’s down $5,000 year over year, despite some of the inefficiencies that you talked about. And I know that a lot is going to change from here, just given how mix is going to evolve, but if you’re successful on the structural pack and front and rear castings and the launch of the 46 80 sell, can you just maybe give us a sense of what a successful outcome would look like maybe a year from now? Obviously a lot has to go right, but just any kind of broad framework for us to think about.","Yeah. It’s really difficult for us to make specific predictions. It’s very difficult. I think you feel confident of say at least 50% growth year over year, next year, and maybe it’s a hundred percent. We need a lot of crystal balls to figure out exactly what it’s going to be. And it is literally impossible to make a specific prediction. But you know, at least 50, maybe 100, something like that."
"But again, it’s an engineering problem. It’s not a question of, if it’s a question of when. On the mixing side, we haven’t actually really had any challenges specific to your question. Fundamentally, we’re still happy with the dry process direction in terms of the factory footprint, complexity, utility consumption, space and overall complexities.",Yeah.
"And I mean, and the cost associated with everything.",Yeah. Don’t over-emphasize dry cathode. Maybe it’s like 10 or 15% of the cost improvement or something like that. I don’t know. 20% maybe?
"Oh, yeah. 10.","Yeah. So people don’t think like, this is like the Messiah or something. You know, wet versus dry, reduces to dry as like 10% less cost than wet. So it’s not 10%, so nothing to sneeze at, especially if you’re making hundreds of gigawatt hours a year. But it’s about the Messiah, basically. Yeah."
"Hey, thanks so much for taking my question. I have another question actually on batteries, but on a slightly different angle. I was wondering how you’re looking at your sourcing strategy for [inaudible 00:50:21] all the work you’re doing to develop your in-house production. But what about asking other battery manufacturers to do for [inaudible 00:50:34] says with their own technology, maybe less innovation than what you guys are lining up internally. And I was wondering if the first 46 80 says that we’ll see on the road will definitely come from Tesla’s own manufacturing lines, or whether they could be coming actually from outside suppliers as well? Now, how did we put up?","Yeah, we, we are in fact working with our existing suppliers to reduce 46 80 format cells. And this is just a guess right now, but I see us consolidating around the 46 80 nickel-based structural pack and for long range vehicles. And then not necessarily a 46 80 format, but some other format for iron based cells."
"Yeah, we, we are in fact working with our existing suppliers to reduce 46 80 format cells. And this is just a guess right now, but I see us consolidating around the 46 80 nickel-based structural pack and for long range vehicles. And then not necessarily a 46 80 format, but some other format for iron based cells.","So we kind of have the Baskin Robbins of batteries situation where there’s so many formats and so many chemistries that it’s like, we’ve got 36 flavors of a battery at this point, you know? This results in an engineering drag coefficient where each variance of cell chemistry and format requires a certain amount of engineering to maintain it and troubleshoot, and this inhibits our forward progress."
"So we kind of have the Baskin Robbins of batteries situation where there’s so many formats and so many chemistries that it’s like, we’ve got 36 flavors of a battery at this point, you know? This results in an engineering drag coefficient where each variance of cell chemistry and format requires a certain amount of engineering to maintain it and troubleshoot, and this inhibits our forward progress.","So it is going to be important to consolidate to maybe ideally two form factors, maybe three. But ideally one nickel chemistry and one iron chemistry, so we don’t have to troubleshoot so many different variants."
"Yeah. And towards that end, we are engaging with the suppliers that we’ve had good partnerships with on 46 80 designs to enable that simplification. So far so good, they’re bringing their core competencies to bear on that. We’re not mandating what’s going on inside, but it’s been a good collaboration.","Yeah. And we do expect to see significant increases in supply from our existing suppliers in addition to the sales that Tesla’s making. So it’s both. Sometimes I get questions from our sales suppliers of like, “Oh, are we just going to make all the cells in ourselves?” So then we’re like nope, please make as many as you possibly can and supply them to us. We have a significant unmet demand in stationary storage. Mega pack is basically sold out through the end of next year I believe."
Yeah.,"We have a massive backlog in Powerwall demand in Powerwall versus production is an insane mismatch. Now, part of that problem is also the semiconductor issue. So we use a lot of the same chips in the Powerwall as we do in the car. So it’s like, which one do you want to make, the cars or Powerwalls? So we need to make cars so that Powerwall production has been reduced. But as that semiconductor shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up. Powerwall production. I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of a million units of Powerwall next year. Maybe towards on the order of 20,000 a week, but again, dependent on self-supply and semiconductors."

And by their nature really need battery packs in order to provide a steady flow of electricity. And when you look at all of the utilities in the world, this is a vast amount of batteries that are needed. That’s why long-term, we really think combined Tesla and suppliers needs to produce at least a thousand gigawatt hours a year and maybe 2000 gigawatt hours a year."
"Okay, great. Thank you. And I have a quick question. I know Elon, you don’t think it’s meaningful today, but I’d be curious to know if you have any stats about when you announced a new pricing on the SAP Marine from 10 grand around to 199. I’d be curious to understand how it affected behavior issues. So like a massive effect begging the service. And I’m not thinking about people looking at this as a message, but more to try the most advanced version of autopilot and to try it. So even on Thursday on the pricing, have you seen like the ACDC can spy in the take rate? And can you give us a sense of how big it was?","Okay. You’re asking like, is the FSD take rate too expensive? And that’s why we’re doing subscription? Or I’m not sure if I understand your question correctly."
"So we took a look at customers in our backlog who have ordered FSD, did they cancel presumably to go to subscription apps or did they take delivery? And the level of cancellations there was not same cannibalization there. It’s possible that that changes, but that was also part of our pricing strategy at $99 and $199.",Yeah.
Also part of our pricing strategy at $99 and $199.,"Yeah. It’s like any given the price is going to be wrong. So we’ll just adjust it over time, as we see if the value proposition makes sense to people. I’m not thinking about this a lot right now. We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition."
"Yeah. It’s like any given the price is going to be wrong. So we’ll just adjust it over time, as we see if the value proposition makes sense to people. I’m not thinking about this a lot right now. We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition.","Otherwise people are kind of… Depending on the future. Like right now, if it doesn’t make sense for somebody to do FSD subscription, I think it’s debatable. But once we have full self-driving widely deployed, then the value proposition will be clear. And at that point, I think basically everyone will go use it. Or a rare individual who doesn’t."
"Okay. Thank you very much for your help. And I think that’s all the time we have for today. Thanks for all your questions. And we’ll speak to you again in three months time. Have a good day, everyone.",Thank you.
"And thank you, Carmen, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla’s first-quarter 2021 q&a webcast. I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question and answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Please press star one now if you would like to join the question to you. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?","Great. Thank you. So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed a billion dollars in non-GAAP net income for the first time, and we’ve seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and our demand is the best we’ve ever seen. So if you talk about we’re used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter, and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1. So Model 3 became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world. In fact, I should say the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world. The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time the best-selling premium sedan, has been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3, and this is only three and a half years into production and was just two factories. For Model 3 to be outselling its combustion engine competitors, I think, is quite remarkable. In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly a quarter million Model 3s, which translates to annualized rate of half a million per year."

So I’m not 100% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely. I’d say more likely than not that in 2022, Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world. Then with regard to full self-driving, full self-driving beta continues to make great progress. It is definitely one of I think one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that’s maybe ever existed, and really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, specifically real-world artificial intelligence. And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer that was designed, but nonetheless a small computer that’s using on the order of 70 or 80 watts."

This has got to fit into a smaller screen, and I think with the elimination of radar, we’re finally getting rid of one of the last crutches. Radar was really … It was making up for some of the shortfalls of vision, but this is not good. You actually just need vision to work, and when your vision works, it works better than the best human because it’s like having eight cameras. It’s like having eyes in the back of your head, beside your head and has three eyes of different focal distances looking forward. This is … And processing it at a speed that is superhuman. There’s no question in my mind that with a pure vision solution, we can make a car that is dramatically safer than the average person. But it is a hard problem, because we are actually solving something quite fundamental about artificial intelligence, where we basically have to solve real-world vision AI, and we are."

So just having well over a million cars on the road that are collecting data from very sort of corner case rare situations, sort of like so many weird things in the world like a truck carrying a truck or a car with … One example is a car, as an actual example, a car with the kayak on the roof where the kayak has a little weight dangling from the front of the kayak in front of the car, but yet the car must ignore this and just look at the road. So it’s really quite tricky, but I am highly confident that we will get this done, so yes."

So Q1 had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we’ve ever experienced in the life of Tesla, and same difficulties with supply chain over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage. This is a huge problem, but then in addition to that, for example, we had quite a difficulty scaling, driving our production in China because we’re unable to get critical engineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions, which meant that Tesla worldwide was dependent on drive units made at our factory in Nevada, Giga Nevada, so that was a very challenging situation. I think we’re mostly out of that particular problem. That was just two of many challenges, so the team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chain shortages."

There’s just a lot of issues encountered ensuring that the new factory was [inaudible 00:08:49], So it took quite a bit of of development to ensure that the battery of the new S/X is safe. And we’re trying to get all the [inaudible 00:09:08] in the cars slowly for the past few months, but we’re just stacking them up in the yard and just making refinements to the cars that we built."

So I think as we ramp up, I think probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high, so it’s really just going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes. So probably we’re going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week. Perhaps if we get lucky, upwards of 2,400 or 2,500. This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which there’s just a lot of factors outside of our control here. But I do think this will get solved, so it’s just a matter of time and then we’ll be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week. It’s a great car. It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce, but it is a superior product."

We’re building factories as quickly as we can. Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well, and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year. At this time, we are continuing to ramp production of Model Y in Fremont and Shanghai. In the background, we’re continuing development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, the Roadster and other products. Thanks to everyone at Tesla who made this year a huge success. Now, on to questions."
Thank you very much. We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.,Okay.
Yeah. I’ll jump in here. So with respect to Dojo …,"Sorry, Zach. My apologies. I was on mute."
"Go ahead, Elon.","So, yeah, I was just basically saying that although like right now people think of Tesla’s … A lot will think of Tesla as a car company or perhaps an energy company. I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company. I think we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world. Certainly, we appear to be able to use things with full self-driving that others cannot. So if you look at the evolution of what technologies we developed, we developed them in order to solve the problem of self-driving, so we couldn’t find a powerful enough neural net that runs a computer, so we designed and built our own. The software out there was really quite primitive for this task, and so we built the team from scratch and have been developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in the world."

Our brain is neural net computer, and the entire road system is designed for vision with a neural net computer, which is because it’s designed for eyes and the brain. And so if you have a system which has very good eyes, you can see in all directions at once, you can see three focal points ahead or forward, but it never gets tired. It’s never texting. It has redundancy and its reaction time is super human, then it seems pretty obvious that such a system would achieve an extremely high level of safety, far in excess of the average person, so that’s what we’re doing."

So because we have over a million cars, and perhaps next year we’ll have two million cars in active use, providing vast amounts of video training data that then needs to be digested by a very powerful training system. And currently, we use Tesla training software. So we developed a lot of training software, a lot of labeling software to do, to able to do surround video labeling, which is quite tricky. This means all eight cameras simultaneously at 36 range a second per camera labeling video over time. There wasn’t any tool that existed for this, so we developed our own labeling tool."

So now we’re getting quite good at auto labeling, where the trainers train the training system and then the system auto labels the data and then the human laborers just need to look at the labeling to confirm that it is correct and perhaps make edits. And then every time an edit is made, that further trains the system. So it’s kind of like a flywheel that’s just sort of spinning up, and really, the only way to do this is with vast amounts of video data. So then we need to train this efficiently, so Dojo is really a supercomputer optimized for neural net training. We think Dojo will be, probably in order of magnitude, more efficient on, say … I’m not sure what the exact right metric is, but say per frame of video, we think it will be an order of magnitude more cost efficient in hardware and in energy usage per frame of video compared to a GPU-based solution or compared to the next best solution that we’re aware of."

It does seem as though over time … I mean just an observation, I think basically is the fact that neural net based computing or AI-based computing is and more and more of the compute stack.Conventional computing, perhaps heuristics-based computing is still going to be important, still going to be very important, but but neural net will become a bigger and bigger portion of compute. So anyway that was a long story but I think, yeah, probably others will want to use it too and we will make it available."
"Thank you very much. Let’s go to the second question from retail investors. The recent price changes on solar roof have been discouraging for customers and investors. Could Tesla share more about solar roof challenges and if the outlook has changed at all, i.e., 1,000 roofs per week?","Yeah. First of all, I should say that the demand for the solar roof remains strong, so despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the solar roofs. So production is going fine, but we are chocked at the inflation point. We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessing the difficulty of certain roofs, but the complexity of roofs varies dramatically. Some roofs are to be literally two or three times easier than other roofs, so you just can’t have a one-size-fits-all situation. If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is it not strong enough to hold the solar roof, then the cost can be double, sometimes three times of what our initial quotes were."

We’ve just got to provide a refund of the early deposit. But what is I think the most important about the solar roof situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we’re shifting the whole sort of solar situation, the solar power … Well, basically, solar power situation to there’s only one product basically … There’s only one configuration. We will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall. That solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solarglass Roof, but in all cases, it will have the power to … Technically, it’s actually Powerwall 2 plus, if you will. The plus refers to a higher peak power capability."

They have about twice the power capability roughly. It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about arguably twice the steady-state power of the specification of the website. The energy is the same, but the power is roughly double. So all installations will have a Powerwall and the difficulty installation will dramatically … Or the difficulty of the installation will be much less. It will be much easier because the power from the solar roof, Solarglass Roof or the solar panels, will only ever go directly into the Powerwall, and the Powerwall will only ever go between the utility and the main power panel of the house, which means you never need to touch the main circuit breakers of the house. You never need to touch the house circuit breakers."

So this is extremely important for scalability is. It’s the only way to do it, really, and this also means that every solar Powerwall installation that the house, or whatever the case may be, will be its own utility. And so even if all lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power, so that gives people energy security. And we can also, in working with the utilities, use the Powerwalls to stabilize the overall grid. So let’s say that there’s, like there was in Texas, there was a peak power demand, and the power demand, because the grid lacked the ability to buffer the power, they had to shut down power. There’s no power storage, no good point on power storage."

And so if the grid needs more power, we can actually then, with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and in partnership with the utility, we can then actually release power onto the grid to take care of peak power demand. So effectively, the Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility. This is profound. I’m not sure how many of you will actually understand this but this is extremely profound and necessary because we are headed toward a world where, as we were just talking about earlier, where people are moving toward electric vehicles. This will mean that the power needs at homes and businesses will increase significantly. There will need to be a bunch more electricity coming somewhere."

So these are rough numbers, but you roughly need twice much electricity if all transport goes electric, and they need three times much electricity if all heating goes electric. So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think, both for Tesla and for the utilities. And in fact, I think if this is not done, the utilities will fail to serve their customers. They won’t be able to do it. They won’t be able to react fast enough, and we’re going to see more and more of what we see, say, in California and Texas of people seeing brownouts and blackouts and the utilities not being able to respond because there’s a massive change going on with the transition to electric transport."

This is a recipe for disaster. So it is very important to have solar and batteries at the local level, at the house. In addition, it is important to have large battery storage at the utility level, so that solar and wind, which are the main forms of renewable electricity, that electricity can be stored because sometimes the wind doesn’t blow. Sometimes it blows wide. Sometimes it blows too much and sometimes it didn’t blow enough, but if you have a battery, you can store the energy and provide the energy to the grid as needed. The same goes for solar because, obviously, the sun does not shine at night and sometimes it is very cloudy, and so by having battery storage paired with solar and wind, this is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future."

Sometimes it blows wide. Sometimes it blows too much and sometimes it didn’t blow enough, but if you have a battery, you can store the energy and provide the energy to the grid as needed. The same goes for solar because, obviously, the sun does not shine at night and sometimes it is very cloudy, and so by having battery storage paired with solar and wind, this is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future.","And as I said, it needs to occur both at the local level and at the utility level. If it doesn’t occur at the local level, what will actually be required is a massive increase in power lines in power plants, so they have to put long distance and local power lines all over the place. They’ll have to increase the size of the substations. It’s a nightmare."

"Well, I can, I’ll take this one guys, from the safety side I continue to say driving the point of- go ahead Elon- I was thinking of… Please go ahead.","I think especially with just going through the facts of the… What I mean specifically, there was an article regarding a tragedy where there was high-speed accident in a Tesla, and there was really just extremely deceptive media practices, where it just blamed the autopilot which is completely false. And those journalists should be ashamed for themselves. Please go ahead. Larson."
"Yeah. Just let me jump in on with vampire drain. That’s definitely not the issue. A good lithium ion cell self discharges, less than 0.001% of its energy per day. So it’s, vampire drain is maybe not…",As mythical as non-buyers.
"Yeah. I think the challenge with seasonal storage is your value proposition drops from hundreds of useful full cycles per year to less than maybe 10, or maybe even less than five cycles per year. So it’s just a different type of technology, you know, altogether. That would make sense, given that it’s more than an order of magnitude different use case.","Yeah. I mean, we’ve got a long way to go before we’re dealing with seasonal technology issues, but certainly a way to deal with seasonal technology would be to have wind and solar barring on the side of what’s more subtly latitudes, but then across a variety of longitude. So essentially, like let’s say in the U S for example, if there was a, I’m not sure if people understand this, that you can actually power the entire United States with just sort of a hundred, roughly a hundred mile by a hundred mile grid of solar."

Almost nothing of this [inaudible 00:40:22] statements is true of almost any country in the world. The solar incidence is a gigawatt per square kilometer. This is insane. In fact, if you took the clear area, just the area for nuclear power plants, the area that is considered not usable because a nuclear power plant is there. In most cases, if you just put solar there it would generate more power than in the nuclear power plant who, because they typically have pretty wide clear areas. If you have say 25% efficient solar panels, and then those are 80% efficient in how they’re laid out, you’re going to do about 200 megawatts per square kilometer. Therefore, you know, five square kilometers is a gigawatt, which might be a typical sort of power plant. It’s really not much area at all. And a lot of places can have wind and solar, same place. So anyway, it’s entirely possible to power all of us with a small percentage of Earth’s area. And then to transmit that power through high voltage DC lines. No new technology. You don’t need like, room temperature superconductors… Also, other myth, room temperature superconductors are almost irrelevant in my opinion, almost irrelevant. Low cost, long distance, power lines using copper or aluminum, are just very important."

So as you increase voltage, you can drop the current dramatically and drop the heating dramatically to the point where it is of minor relevance. Like maybe, you lose five to seven percent with a high voltage DC power line, something like that. So I want to clear, no new physics is necessary, no new materials necessary. We just need to scale this thing up. The technologies exist today to solve renewable energy."

That’s because the energy base of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanely gigantic. So you can’t just go and do a zillion terawatts overnight. You’ve got to build the production capacity for the cells, for the battery cells, for solar cells. You’ve got to put that into vehicles. You’ve got to put that into stationary storage packs. You’ve got to put out your solar panels and solar cost roofs, and you’ve got to deploy all this stuff. But it is certainly the case that we can accelerate this and we should try to accelerate it."

And we would tend to tax fruit and vegetables less. The same should be true. We should, we should tax energy that we think is probably bad and support energy you think is probably good, just like cigarettes and alcohol versus the fruits and vegetables. It’s just common sense. On the plus side, I’m not suggesting anyone to be complacent, but sustainable energy, renewable energy will be solved. It is being solved. But it matters how fast we solve it. And if we solve it faster, that’s better for the world."
Thank you very much.,"There’s no question in my mind whatsoever that the energy storage problem can be solved with lithium ion batteries. Zero. I want to be clear. Zero. I think the bias will tend to be towards iron based lithium ion cells who, people might think, look, there must be a big constituent of the cells. It’s more like one to two percent of the cell is lithium. The main part of the cell is the cathode. The main mass and cost in the cell is the cathode. For high energy cells, for example what we use in most, most houses have have nickel based lithium-ion cells, which have higher energy density, longer range than iron based cells."

And so I think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron based lithium ion cells with an iron phosphate cathode, technically. But I think the phosphate part is unnecessary. It’s really just the iron or nickel. I’m misreading the terminology. Just think of it as iron and nickel, and there is an insane amount of iron in the world. More iron than we could possibly use. There’s also more lithium than we could possibly use. Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron phosphate lithium ion cells."
"Thank you very much. Let’s go through the next question from institutional investors, which is, you’ve suggested that between a five X to 10 X improvement is achievable in the automotive production versus the first model three line on the first principles physics analysis. Where does Berlin sit? Where does Berlin sit relative to that limit?","Oh, I think we’re so we’re so quite far away from it. I mean, the thing to bear in mind with production is, for those who have never done production, they just don’t understand how insanely hard production is. I want to really be very, very emphatic here. Prototypes are trivial. They’re child’s play. Production is hard. It is very hard. Now you say production at large-scale with higher liability and low cost, insanely difficult."

If even one of those items is slow. That situate just one doesn’t matter, so trivial we’ve had production stuff because of carpet and the trunk. We have production stuff because a USB cable, at one point for wireless, we literally raided every electronics store in the bay area for, a few days there, nobody could buy a USB cable on the barrier because we, went and bought them all to put them in the car, literally. And there’s like hundreds of stories like that. So anyway, that’s the solving those constraints and, a logistics problem that makes world war II look trivial. I’m not kidding. Like the scale is insane, we told him no, he ends up cars, some massive global supply chain, 50 countries, dozens of regulatory regimes. It’s the same. So, yeah."
Thank you. Yeah. And last question from institutional investor is master plan of part two talks about an urban transport vehicle that is smaller than traditional bus with greater aerial density achieved by removing the central aisle. Do you have any updates to share on this goal?,Not at this time.
"Hi guys, Thanks for taking my question. I’d love to get back to you in a day from what you presented on the battery day in the last six, seven minutes. I wasn’t very how much progress you’ve made on that first in terms of process development. So how are things coming together on your pilot line? Are you getting into the kind of production which you are aiming for? And second is actually on your production ramp. So I was wondering in which sides you’re ramping production capacities also with office 680 sale and where you stand on ramping of that capacity as well. And I’ll have a quick photo on, and I’ll just use that specimen.","[inaudible 00:50:56] but we have the small sort of pallet plants, which is still big by normal standards, expect to have like a 10 gigawatt app for your capability and pretty much California. And were they quite a few cells? We’re not, quite yet at the point where we think cells are reliable enough to be shipped in cars, but we’re getting close to that point. And, and then we’ve already, ordered most of the equipment for battery production in Berlin and Austin as well."

[crosstalk 00:52:11]."
"There’s one thing I would add is there’s been a lot of questions about yields. Actually. I noticed people asking about that and, the yield progress has been really strong every day. And we were really still in commissioning phase with most of the tools to the point where we’re confident that the yield trajectory aligns with our internal cost projections. We just talk about yield also at better days, because there’s other reasons why it’s useful to check in on that. It takes a while, as Elon just mentioned to go from a prototype to production, and it’s not just parts it’s processes, it’s equipment, but as we’ve matured so does the the process equipment we’ve, gotten to where we need to be on the yield side.","Yeah, basically this is just a guess, because we don’t know for sure, but it appears as though we are about 12 probably not more than 18 months away from volume production at the rate of 46 80. Now at the same time, we are actually trying to have our outsell supply of partners ramp up their supply as much as possible. So this is not something that is to the exclusion of suppliers. It is in conjunction with suppliers. So we’re super clear about that. This is not about replacing suppliers. It is about supplementing suppliers. So we have a very strong partnership with CATL with Panasonic and LG, our request to our strategic partners for sale supply is please supply with as much as you possibly can, provided the prices affordable. We will buy everything that they can make."
"Yeah. Yeah. And specific to that, we’re on track to more than double the supplier capacity over the next 13.","Yeah exactly, we do expect from suppliers to receive double sell output next year versus this year."
"Yeah. We’re, seeing a lot of [crosstalk 00:55:05].","We’re ending poker problem margins in storage as in, vehicle, but it is important. Bear in mind that vehicle is more mature than the storage. So we already are at good margins with the Power wall, but some additional work is needed, put a mega pack to achieve good margins pretty quick."
"Yeah. Sorry, just jumping in ELon. Absolutely agree, yeah. Power wall is mature. We’ve been producing power wall two for three years now and we’re at good margins there, but Mega pack has more room to go to achieve our targets.","We have, a clear runway for improving the customer, the megawatt hour, the mega pack."
"Hi everybody. I was hoping maybe you just first, you could talk a little bit about how you’re thinking about the rollout of version nine of SSD and the transition to the subscription model. It sounds like some, of this is about to roll out next month. I’m not sure if that’s a subscription model, but maybe you could just spend a little time talking about how impactful you expect that to be?","So I got, go ahead again. Yeah."
"Hi, good evening. Thanks, to two questions. One is on cogs. I think we’ve gotten from battery day a pretty good feel about the potential for cogs reduction related to powertrain, but I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing cogs ex powertrain. Is it still need a meaningful reduction on that front to make the math work on a $25,000 vehicle? So what levers do you have to reducing your cost X powertrain? Is it just more scale, better supplier pricing, or is it just based on ongoing cost reduction?",I think all of the above.
"Great. And then just related, as BC Berlin and an Austin ramp, but I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont non optimized, because you bought the old NUMMI facility you had to retrofit that to your need. So maybe you can give us a sense of how your new capacity is going to differ versus Fremont. What are the areas that you have efficiencies that you previously didn’t have and maybe, how much does that add up to improve cogs over time to help you achieve that $25,000 vehicle?","Yeah, we won’t talk too much about spiritual product development, conference calls are not, the right place to make major part announcements, but yeah, we’ll get there, but we’ll provide later."
"Oh, all right. Thank you very much. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for today. Thank you very much for dialing in and for listening. And we’ll speak to you again in about three months. Thank you. Bye.",Thanks sir.
"Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla’s fourth-quarter 2020 Q&A webcast. I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 1:00 P.M. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question and answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one followup, and please press star-one now if you’d like to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?","Thank you. So just to recap the year. 2020 was a defining year for us on many levels. Despite a challenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5 million cars. I’d just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort. We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history, so really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging 2020, so my hat is off to such hard work with such great people at Tesla."

We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow. Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity. We started producing the model out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed. We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly. We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles. We started and we’re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings for Model Y. This is where, for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made. We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year. We’re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.

So we’ve been able to bring forward the pad Model S and X, and Model S will be delivered in February and Model X a little later. The Model S pad, and we’re actually in production now, and we’ll be delivering next month. So this is a tri motor Model S with a completely new interior. There are actually a lot of great things about this. I’ll do another call about the Model S later, but it’s really a tremendous improvement over the prior version."

This is a luxury stand that is able to go 0 to 60 in less than two seconds and will have the ability to seat up to seven people with the third row seats, so this is pretty nice. This is faster to be clear than any car. It’s not like there was a different type of car, like a two-door sports car that was able to do that.

It’s very common for me to have no interventions on drives that I do, including drives to a place that I’ve never been to. So these are not preplanned routes. The car has never been there before, and it’s now actually more common than not for the car to have no interventions, even on a complex drive. Basically, I’m highly confident the car will drive itself for the reliability in excess of a human this year. This is a very big deal, and thinking about like how does one justify the value of the company being where it is? And I think there is a way, just with back of the on road map to potentially justify it, where if Tesla ships, let’s say, hypothetically, $50 billion or $60 billion worth of vehicles, and those vehicles become full self-driving and can be used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an average of 12 hours a week to potentially an average of 60 hours a week, if they’re capable of serving as robotaxi.

If that’s the case, then you get 20 PE on that, it’s like $1 trillion and the company is still in high-growth mode.

But assume that ’21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint. I think it’s going to be a great year for Tesla. We’ve got many great new products coming out. We’ve got factories that are advanced factories out of [inaudible 00:09:54] production.","It will also make it easier how you’re having a factory in Berlin, one, in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint. Texas can help supply the eastern half of the U.S., and Berlin can help supply Europe. And there’s just pure cars on both, much less capital tied up with big cars that have been transported to customers. I think the fundamental efficiency of the company will be much better with the factories or at least having factories on each continent and having two factories in the U.S. So I’m super excited about the future, and yes, we look forward to making it happen. Thank you."
Thank you very much. And now we can jump straight into questions from Say Technologies. The first question from institutional investors is what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share leader in solar?,"Yeah. So we’re actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter over quarter last year, and we had our best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4. So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it. Unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building. We had to take the whole company, including a bunch of people that were on solar and had to work on cars, but now we’ve got a little more bandwidth, we’re putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly. So I think it will not be long before Tesla is by far the market leader in solar."
"And I think I mentioned, this is a really important part with industry-leading pricing to become the leader in this space.","Yeah. And actually, an important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar and Tesla Roof. And we’re confident we’ll have excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar whether it’s retrofit, or the [inaudible 00:16:30] Roof before the end of the year. So I think we’ve got a good strategy. As Zach mentioned, we’re focused on reducing the amount of time and the complexity of the install, and we’re making great progress in that regard. And I think we’ll have something that’s really dialed in this year."
"Thank you. The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to their next vehicle? This would be a huge for loyalty and overall increase sales of vehicles who are offering more FSD sales on use vehicles.","Unfortunately, we’re not considering that at this time. We do actually offer a higher price for a car with the FSD than the one without FSD. And I do think that the market currently undervalues… The consumer market, and arguably the stock market, does probably undervalue just how good FSD is going to be. But we’re not currently planning allowing it to get transferred."
Thank you.,We will be offering subscription pretty soon in the next month or two. So that should address a lot of people’s concerns for being able to get it.
"Thank you very much. And the third question is, can you give us a progress update on dry coating of the battery electrodes. At the Battery Day, Elon said, “I would not say this is completely in the bag, as yet as the yields were low.”",Andrew?
"Okay, thank you very much. The next question is why are you confident Tesla will achieve Level 5 autonomy in 2021? And why is Dojo not necessary to get there?","I guess I’m competence based on my understanding of the technical roadmap and the progress that we’re making between each beta iteration. Yeah. As I was saying, it’s not remarkable at all for the car to completely drive you from one location to another through a series of complex intersections. It’s now about just improving the corner case reliability and getting it to 99.9999% reliable, with respect to an accident. Basically, we need to get it to better than human by a factor of at least 100% or 200%. And this is happening rapidly because we’ve got so much training data with all the cars in the field. And the software is improving dramatically. We also write the software for [inaudible 00:20:47]. And I’ll say, it is quite challenging. We’re moving everything towards video labeling"

We’re moving everything towards video labeling","So all video labeling for video inference. And so there’s still a few of the neural nets that need to be upgraded to video training and video inference. And really, as we transition to each net to video, the performance has become exceptional. So this is a hard thing. The labeling software that we work for, video labeling, making that better has a huge effect on the efficiency of labeling. And then, of course, the Holy Grail is auto labeling. So we’re putting a lot of work into having the labeling tool be more efficient when used by a person, as well as enabling auto labeling, where we can. Dojo is a training supercomputer. We think it may be the best neural net training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude. So it is a whole thing in and of itself. And this is something we could offer potentially as a service. So some of the others need neural net training. We’re not trying to keep it to ourselves."

And then, of course, for training vast amounts of video data, and getting the reliability from 100% to 200% better than an average human to 2,000% better than average human. So that will be very helpful in that regard."
Thank you. The next question is what is Tesla’s current gigawatt-hour run rate of of the 4680 cell production? How do you see these run rate evolving by mid-2021 or end of 2021?,"I think we kind of talked about that through. Essentially, what we’re saying is that the number to think about or focus on is we’ve got a 100 gigawatt-hour total that Tesla cells produced in 2022. It’s not that important to look at the run-up to that, because these things tend to improve exponentially. But we are installing capacity, in 2022, for 200 gigawatt hours a year, and we think probably we should be able to achieve 30% of targeted design capacity in 2022."
"Yeah. Yeah. Agreed, Elon. And as you’ve said before, with the S-Curve of production, you can be off a little bit on the initial part of the S-Curve, and that makes a difference in absolute capacity by quite a bit, one month to the next. So, yeah, we are progressing up that S-Curve as fast as we possibly can.",Yeah. And we don’t see any showstoppers.
"Thank you very much. And now let’s go to institutional investor questions. The question number one, what are the key milestones we need to achieve in order to evolve current FSD to a commercial Level 4, Level 5 ride sharing solution?","Yeah. So it really goes back to what I was saying a moment ago, which is, we need to transition over the neural nets in the car to a video. And in order to do that, the whole stack has to be changed to video. That means gathering video clips, then using… And this is actually surround video. So you’ve got eight cameras operating simultaneously with synchronized frame rates. So you’ve got basically eight camera around video. And then you’ve got to label basically everything in that video snippet, and then train against that, and then have those neural nets operate the car. And this is coming from the past where we would label… The neural nets would be a single camera, single frame. So no video, and not combining the cameras. And then we went from a single frame, one frame at a time, one camera at a time neural nets, to surround camera… Neural nets would look at all eight cameras, but only one frame at a time, and now to where we include the time dimension, and that’s video."

And we’re also going to be expanding the FSD beta itself to include more and more people. So from my standpoint, it looks like a very clear and obvious path towards a vehicle that will drive 100% safer than a person. Yeah. I really don’t see any obstacles here."
"Thank you. Thank you. And the second question from institutionals is, does Tesla plan or expect to license any of its software applications, FSD, and Autobidder in particular, to third-party OEMs?","I think we are very open to licensing our software to third parties. And we’ve had some preliminary discussions about licensing autopilots to other OEMs. So this is something we’re more than happy to do. But I think, obviously, we need to probably do a little bit more work to prove that Tesla autopilot is capable of full self-driving, which, like I said, I think will become obvious later this year. And then we’re more than happy to license that to other car companies. We’re definitely not trying to keep it to be a Tesla exclusive situation. And I think the probably same goes to Autobidder. We haven’t thought as much about Autobidder. But the Tesla philosophy is definitely not to create walled gardens. We’re going to allow other companies to our supercharger networks. And yeah, using our autonomy software and Autobidder, and perhaps other things, would be fine too."
"Thank you. The next question is, key differences in product customer preferences, FSD strategy between China and the rest of the world. Do we need to do things differently to win the Chinese EV markets?","Well, we are currently the leader in the Chinese EV market. So I think we must be doing something right if we’re the best selling electric car in China. That said, very few of our customers in China. I admit, maybe as low as one or 2%, actually have selected the FSD option. This is much lower than rest of the world. So we definitely need to make it work well in China. I think, some of it works well in China, then we will have a [inaudible 00:31:53] for FSD. I find the customers in China, Tesla owners in China, are among the most discerning in the world."

I’m confident that they will buy [inaudible 00:32:14] worked in long term. And hopefully, that is later this year."
"Thank you. And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about the company’s long-term earnings power is tied to profit per unit of battery capacity? Three terawatt hours targets from battery, they imply is half of long-term battery capacity goes through storage, depending on what you assume for Packsize on the Elon’s 20 million vehicle unit goals.","Yeah, it is. So, the fundamental limits on electric vehicles right now, in general, is availability of cells. What’s the output of battery cells in jiggawat hours, and you can’t grow faster than that. Now, at Tesla we’ve improved the efficiency of our product dramatically, such that you can actually get pretty good range, even with the standard range e-pack. It’s projected for model three, it’s approaching the high two hundreds. And, with some slight continued improvements, we’ll get to the 300 mile range to a standard pack, and [inaudible 00:33:34] 500 kilometers."

But fundamentally the growth is dependent on cell production. And there’s actually a lot of other companies that want to, that have a need for cells. So, the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth. It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers. In fact, I want to be really clear Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers. And we’ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL, or Panasonic, or LG, that we will take as many batteries as they can produce."

Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable. But I’m trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers, it is to supplement our suppliers. And we want to have suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition, have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production."

And so, probably since the cell output drives vehicle output, then probably the broad brushstroke value of Tesla is just, what’s the set off of [inaudible 00:35:32] that vehicle output. And then, at least double that for autonomy revenue. Probably won’t’ level, and that’s how you figure out the value of the company in the long term."
"Thank you very much. The next question is about 46/80 cells, which we already covered in the retail section of this call. So, let’s go straight to the last question from Institutional Investors, which is, “Where are you in cyber truck development? What are your expectations for cyber truck deliveries in 2021?”","Right. So, we’re finished with the cyber truck engineering. So, we’re no longer iterating at the design center level or the line level. We’ve got design specs, we’re getting to order the equipment necessary to make the cyber truck work. We’re actually going to be using even bigger testing machines for the rear body of cyber truck, because you’ve got a bigger vehicle and you’ve got a long truck bed that’s going to split a lot of load."

We’re actually going to be using even bigger testing machines for the rear body of cyber truck, because you’ve got a bigger vehicle and you’ve got a long truck bed that’s going to split a lot of load.","So, we’ll be using an 8,000 tons casting press for the rear body casting as opposed to 6,000 tons for a Model Y. So, 6,000 tons was the biggest cast Tesla mold, 8,000 tons is quite a bit bigger than that. And I think it’s an incredible vehicle. If we get lucky, we’ll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year. But I expect volume production to be in 2022."
"Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the regulatory environment for FST and how you’re seeing that play out? Obviously, it’s a bit of a moving target right now, and you guys are leading the way here, but we’d love to understand how those conversations are going and how you see that impacting the roll out of FST throughout the balance of this year and into next year.","Okay. Zach, do you want to [inaudible 00:37:56]?"
"Great, thanks. Was wondering, you mentioned how you’d like to increase your purchases of cells from suppliers. Does this require them to also have the capability to build structural 40/60/80 cells of the sort that you’re putting in these newer iterations of vehicles?","No, it does not. Although we are talking with them about making the 40/60/80 point factor, it is not required. For example, the new S Car B uses the 18650 form factor. So, that’s just a more advanced cell. And we think we’ll continue to use that form factor for at least a few years, but we will over time be retiring the form factors and trying to move to a consistent form factor. But it is not a requirement that we place on our suppliers, because it just results in fewer cells. So, it’s better for us to deal with the complexity of different cell form factors than insist on a single form factor for our suppliers today. Like I said, over time, it will make sense to have a consistent form factor."
"Okay. Makes sense. And then one additional maybe qualitative question on capacity expansion, you’ve mentioned in the past, I mean, access to dollars is one thing, but access to human beings that are sufficiently qualified is another. Have you run up against any issues on that front that would potentially limit your growth in any way? Thanks.","That is one of the things that limits to growth rates. It doesn’t limit the ultimate size, but limits the growth rate, which is the rate at which we can onboard great people and get them trained in the right areas. You usually can’t, like instantaneously, if you’ve got a factory that has 20,000 employees, you can’t just hire 20,000 people instantly. They’ll usually bring something else. So, they’ve got to transition from whatever they were doing or move from some other part of the country. And so, there’s a certain amount of time required for that."

And so, there’s a certain amount of time required for that.","That said, we do think that we can maintain a growth rate in excess of 50% per year, for many years to come. At least we’re producing here for many years to come. I think this year we may attract to a fair bit about 50%, but we don’t want to commit to that. But at least that’s what it would appear, and the same again next year, it appears to be hopefully about 50%."
"Thanks. Elon, back in 2018, you tweeted about electric vans and how it could be interesting to work with Diane Lornepriner. We haven’t really heard of anything since, but in the meantime, we’ve seen a lot of activity in that electric van and last mile space from a number of established players and startups. So, I know you said that you have a lot of projects on the table, but can you provide us an update of your thoughts on this market? And is it something you’re interested in?","I think Tesla is definitely going to make an electric van at some point. Some things to bear in mind is that there is fundamentally a constraint on battery cell output. So, if you’re not involved in manufacturing, it’s really hard to appreciate just how hard is this to scale production. It’s just the hardest thing in the world. Prototypes are easy, scaling production is very hard. So, a big part of the reason, the main reason we have not accelerated new products is, like for example, the Tesla semi, is that we simply don’t have enough cells for it. If we were to make-"

If we were to make the semi like right now, which we could easily go into production with the semi, but we would not have enough to cells built for it right now. We will have enough cells for Semi when we are producing the 4680 volume. But for example, Semi would use typically five times the number of cells that a car would use, but it would not sell for five times what a car would sell for. So it kind of doesn’t make … It would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint. The same would go for that."
"Okay. Thank you. And then maybe if I could dig into your past on one more item. About two years ago, at the Autonomy Day, you stated that you’re working on the next-gen Tesla chip which was about two years away. So is there any update on that front?","Yeah, to be clear, the software still does not fully use the capabilities of the FSD version one computer. It is really just an incredibly powerful computer, and I am personally certain that you can create full self-driving with safe Level 5 [inaudible 00:49:23] just using the full self-driving Version 1 computer. The Version 2, we expect to be about three times as powerful, and this needs to be paired with higher resolution cameras. And so it requires a bunch of things to change simultaneously. But we have not been rushing the Version 2 of the chip. It’s coming along well, and it’s in good shape, but since we can achieve FSD, full self-driving, with the current system, it would actually be a distraction right now if we were to introduce the Tesla FSD chip 2 because it would set us back quite a bit on software, and software is the critical path to full self-driving. So I wouldn’t worry too much about that. That’s an improvement but not a game changer. That has to be changed. Getting the software to work and getting all the neural nets to the video, that’s the game changer."
"Thank you very much. My first question is about your in-house cell manufacturing efforts. So in addition to building up capacity, some of the goals you highlighted was to cut the pricing or the cost by about 50%, boost the range by about 50% over a number of years. So wanted to know if your initial efforts are trending in that direction? What is, sort, of like the timeline to achieve these goals? And maybe related to this, how are you thinking about the time line for the cheaper Tesla, the entry model, eventually?","I think we feel very confident about achieving those targets, let’s say, over a three-year time frame. I don’t know. It’s not like year one. So three, maybe four years, give ourselves a little room. But for three or four years, I’d say."
"Yeah. We put together the trajectory in the Battery Day, and we’re on that trajectory still. I think that’s probably the best reference for the cost trajectory that we are on.","Yeah. We’re aspiring to do better than Battery Day, but we are confident of at least for doing what we presented at Battery Day."
"Hey, guys. Thank you, Elon. Congrats to the whole team. So we’re trying to put together all the breadcrumbs. If I remember correctly, going back 10 years, you talked about when you have a mass market car on the road, that you’d step down as CEO and be a chief architect. And then we have, you go into Hawaii, subsea lair and the x.com, and I’m trying to put it all together. There’s a lot of questions there. Thank you.","Sure. Well, I expect to be CEO of Tesla for several years, so I think there’s still a lot that I’m super excited about doing, and I think it would be hard to leave a lot of these great projects halfway or part like hallway done. So I do expect to be running the company for several years into the future. Now obviously, nobody is or should be CEO forever, so I don’t expect to be. The sheer amount of work required to be CEO of Tesla is insane, and I think I definitely do more technical work than is typical for a CEO. So it would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands as opposed to just working day and night, from when I wake up to when I go to sleep seven days a week. It’s pretty intense, but I think the mission isn’t over yet, and we still got a long way ago before we can really make a dent in the world on accelerating the advent of sustainable energy."

So that’s the full have long way to go for on the order of 1% of the fleet is electric. There’s also a tremendous way to go on solar power, although it’s exciting to see the advent of very cost-competitive wind and solar and geothermal. Of course, we need a large volume of stationary battery packs. I mean basically, maybe the three legs of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, led by solar, wind, geothermal and hydro and a few others. I’m actually not against nuclear fission. I actually think nuclear fission is, with a well-designed reactor in a situation that is not subject to bad weather or seriously bad weather is actually is a good thing to do."

The wind doesn’t blow all the time. The sun doesn’t shine all the time, so you need a lot of batteries, and it needs to be very long-lasting and high cycle life, and then you need electric transport. If you have those three things, we’ve got a very bright future with respect to energy and the environment. So a long way to go on that, and so I’m still very much fired up to work on that."
"I was happy to see the update on the timing of Semi and had a couple of related questions. And first, since Semi Trucks typically travel predictable highway miles, will Tesla Semi may be the first to achieve full autonomy?","I think that’s quite likely, yes. Yes, I can’t imagine … I’m not sure who would be number two, but yes, it seems highly likely, yes."
"The hardware, it’s the exact same part numbers on the Semi on the Tesla cars. There’s no difference.","Yeah. That’s true. Yeah. As it is, we need to modify the parameters. Software parameters change for autopilot or self-driving because it needs now to Model 3, Model Y, Model X or Model S. We just need to inform the vehicle, inform the full self-driving brain that it is now in a Semi Truck."
Would it need to be retrained then as part of that?,"No. I think there will be … You have a different control functions because there are turns that you could do in a regular car that you cannot do in a Semi, like you do want to try to parallel park this thing on the street in a city. It needs to know its limitations being a giant truck."
Makes sense. My follow-up question was related to if you could just help us explain why battery electric will win versus hydrogen cell fuel tech?,"Yeah. I mean, honestly, I’ve had this question a million times for just for regular vehicles, even back in the early Roadster days, even before we had the Roadster out. People were saying that somehow hydrogen is going to be a better means of energy storage in a car than batteries, and it was like this is just really not the case. Hydrogen is a very … It’s number one in the periodic table. It’s got very low density. It’s got low density as a liquid, like styrofoam-level density as a liquid. And then it’s only a liquid very close to absolute zero, so you have to have a … It’s really not realistic to keep it as liquid. You want to have it as a high-pressure gas that has even lower density, so you need a gigantic fuel tank volumetrically, and it’s got to be very high pressure. It’s a big pain in the ass, basically."

It’s a big pain in the ass, basically.","If somebody is going to, say, use an ultimate chemical energy storage mechanism to hydrogen, I’d say just use propane or something like that or methane. Those will be way better than hydrogen. And then having it be a fuel cell just adds even further complications to the situation. It’s just crazy basically. And we’re extremely confident that we could a long-range trucking with batteries. The math works out. If you could just take, say, watt-hours per kilogram of currently available cells, and say, “Okay, what weight would you need to go, let’s say, 500 miles, and to what degree does that affect your payload?” It’s like, “Okay, if you do it right, you basically have no effect on your payload or almost nothing, and you can have a long-range truck.” I mean, Jerome, do you want to add to that?"
"Well, I agree with everything, and we see also an increase on the regionalization of trucks, and I think it will be perfect. The Tesla Semi will be perfect for it, yes. I’m looking forward to having some additional ones on the road very soon.","But basically, we do not see any issues with creating a compelling long-range truck with batteries. Apart from cell supply. Cell supply is the only thing. Cell supply’s it."
I think it’s going to be awesome.,Yeah.
"All right. Thank you very much. And unfortunately, that’s all the time we have today, so thanks for all of your great questions, and we will speak to you again in about three months. Thank you. Thanks, Elon.",Thanks. Bye.
"Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla’s third quarter 2020 Q&A webcast. I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 1:00 PM Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please press star one now if you would like to join the question queue. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?","Thanks, Martin. All right, so Q3 was our best quarter in history. We achieved the record production deliveries, record revenue, record net income; both GAAP and non-GAAP and record free cash flow of $1.4 billion. This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team. I could not be more proud to work with such a great group of people. Just really kick-ass performance throughout the world. Of course, we had our Battery Day. So we hosted, showed our plans for how we can expand in the future and improve core battery technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistry level and I think more significantly at the manufacturing technology level. There’s a comment I made in the past is that I think Tesla’s long-term competitive strength will be primarily manufacturing. This is counterintuitive, but I’m quite confident this will be what happens."

We wanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch. First, wishful thinking, just look at it from the fundamental physics and say rather than compare to other products in the market, just say from a physics standpoint, what’s the limit of physics? What’s the platonic idea of the perfect cell and how close can we get there? And that was our aspiration. I think we’ve got a pretty good approach to it, which will have to get better over time. And we went through all of the engineering solutions for every important part of battery design and production, and we’ll continue to iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology. The result, we think, in a few years will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capital expenditures required are a-third or less of what they are today, and we expect Giga Berlin will see our first battery cell production line at scale."

I spent a lot of time with the Autopilot team. And there’s a lot of really talented people in that team who’ve worked incredibly hard to get the beta release out, so I’d just really like to thank them for their hard work. And it’s just a very smart group of people. So I think we’re starting very slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place, and so we put it out there last night, and then we’ll see how it goes and then probably release it to more people this weekend or early next week, and then just gradually step it up until we have, hopefully, a wide release by the end of this year. And of course, as the system collects more data and it becomes more robust."

It’s because everyone is programming it by asking questions all the time and clicking on particular links, so it’s got this great feedback and that makes it an extremely effective search engine. It’s the same thing for autonomy, having on the order of a million cars that are providing feedback and specifically feedback on strange corner case situations that you just can’t even come up with in simulation. This is the thing that is really valuable. It’s not like the obvious stuff you can do in simulation, but weird corner cases. Only reality can give you that. But we’re able to say, “Okay, we need to train the system on this corner case situation and look for examples, so we can then try it against those examples and improve some very esoteric corner case.”"

There is no need for high-definition maps or a cellphone connection, so the system is designed such that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you’re in a place that you have never been to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like a person. That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year."

We’re continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well at Tesla China team. It is just, I mean, incredibly good. Super smart, work hard. It’s like I’m always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes. It’s beyond all reasonable expectations. And then we’re under construction in Berlin and Texas and Austin, so we’re also making good progress there. Yeah. Good. It’s overall going well. I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin, we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year, but because of the exponential nature of the spool up of a manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it will start off very slow at first and then afterward will become very large."

But it will typically take about 12 to 18 months to reach capacity, and that is a very fast period of time, especially for new technology. So yes, I’d say, 12 to 24 months even. So generally, what I see is the manufacturing capacity is underestimated in the beginning for quite some time, then it is sometimes overestimated because this is an s-curve. It goes exponential to linear to logarithmic, and it’s actually an incredibly hard thing, just bringing a production plant up to volume technology."

Which one is the laggard? Which one is the leader? It’s very difficult to tell, and it’s constantly changing, so it’s really one of the most difficult challenges I’ve ever seen. So let’s see. In conclusion, thank you. What we would achieve would not be possible without the incredible hard work of the tens of thousands of Tesla employees and all people and our suppliers as well. I’d like to thank our suppliers. We continue to grow as fast as we can while focusing on cost control and improving quality, and ultimately the best company will be that which makes great products at an affordable price, and that’s our goal. I think I’ve never felt more optimistic about the future of Tesla than I do today. I’d also like to thank investors who have stuck with us through thick and thin. I think there’s a lot more good stuff to come. All right. With that, we can move to questions."
"Thank you, Elon. I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some opening remarks as well.",Okay. Sure.
"Thank you very much, everyone. And let’s begin with questions from say.com. The first question from retail shareholders is is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the same time as vehicle production? Can Tesla share more information on what products you’ll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?","Yeah. Drew, do you want to take that?"
"Thank you, Carl.","Yeah. I mean, here’s the way to think about a product, in my opinion. You have to say, I think, what do you want the world to look like? When you look around the neighborhood in future a decade from now, what do you want? What products are going to make your life better? What future do you want? And I think a future where we’ve got beautiful roofs with generating energy that are tough and resilient and better in every way than a regular roof and a lab with energy, that’s the future we want. The Solar Roof is a killer product. This will become obvious next year."
"Thank you. And the last question from retail shareholders is, you recently referred to Tesla as a conglomerate of start-ups. Other than manufacturing electric cars, what do you suppose will be the most valuable business units within Tesla over the next five to seven years? Could you envision any of them ever spinning out from Tesla?","Well, as I think about this today. Tesla has probably … There’s probably in excess of a dozen startups effectively in Tesla. Every major product line is a start-up. Every big new plant is a start-up and sometimes, frankly, we have to learn a lesson a few times before it sinks in. Even things like service and sales are startups. Other car companies, OEMs, they don’t own their sales and service, so we have to create our service network. We have to create our sales and delivery network. We have to do this in, I don’t know, 40 countries, multiple languages. So many people don’t really even know much about is our internal applications team that writes the core technology that runs the company."

For those who understand what this means, this is a very big deal. And my hat’s off to the great work of the internal applications team. They are like the nervous system, the operating system of the Company, the Tesla operating system, extremely fundamental. Obviously, insurance is substantial. So insurance could very well be 30%, 40% of the value of the car business, frankly. And as we’ve talked about before, with a much better feedback group, instead of being statistical, it can be specific. And obviously, somebody does not have to choose our insurance, but I think a lot of people will. It’s going to cost less and be better. So why wouldn’t you?"

And obviously, somebody does not have to choose our insurance, but I think a lot of people will. It’s going to cost less and be better. So why wouldn’t you?","And the whole autonomy thing is a start-up. Designing our computer chips was a start-up. Obviously, cells are a start up. Designing and making our own power electronics for the drive unit, design, manufacturing our own motors, chargers, the Supercharger network is a start-up. I think that people just don’t really understand about Tesla is that it’s a whole chain of startups and like, “Well, you didn’t do that before.” Yeah, but we’re doing it now. I mean, I think so far, we’ve maybe been a bit slow with some of the start-ups, but I don’t think we’ve had any of them fail. So, so far so good. No plans to spin anything out. That just sounds like added complexity."
"Thank you very much. Let’s go through institutional investor questions. The question number one is as a bridge to the ride-hailing network, could you leverage the insurance product to give customers the ability to rent out their vehicles via the app, thereby enabling the car to make money for them, so basically proprietary version of Toro.","We think we’re focused on enabling the robotaxi system. So you can just basically … That’s really quite a small subset of the overall robotaxi or robocar thing where you can have the car get autonomous for you. You can have the car be you have to share with friends and family. You can add or remove it from the network. You can have it be entirely in the network. I mean, if you’re an Uber or Lyft driver, you could be managing a fleet of 10 cars. This sort of seems like a shepherd tending the flock type of thing. It’s like you just get way more leverage. So I think we could do that. It wouldn’t be very difficult, but we’re going to just be focused on just having an autonomous network. That has sort of elements of Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. Yeah."
Yes.,"Yeah, go ahead, Drew."
"I was just going to say, I mean, I think one of the things we focused on with the Model Y and now Model 3 pump system was learning how to build a tightly integrated system capable of moving heat to and from anywhere really, powertrain battery, cabin, the environment, in outside ambient temperatures all the way down to like negative 20 C, so 30 C, and that’s definitely applicable to the home needs of heating and cooling the home and the water in your house, so certainly applicable. Elon?","Yeah, absolutely. I think for heat pump in the car, being able to use the batteries, both as a thermal and an electric energy reservoir is very significant. Same thing could be applied to a home with the water heater and the battery pack itself, of course. So I think there’s potential for an integrated home system that kind of does power generation storage, heating, cooling, air filtration, water purification in a really tight package. We don’t actually have a prototype or anything, but I think conceptually, that is something that would be probably good to have."
"Thank you. The third question from institutionals is if meeting your long-term volume targets requires price reductions that preclude you from achieving your low double-digit stated margin targets for the autos business, will you still reduce prices accordingly?","Well, we want to make our cars more affordable, and it’s really important to separate out affordability from value for money. If the car is too expensive or any given product is too expensive and people don’t have enough money in the bank account, they simply can’t buy it no matter what the value proposition is. So it is important to lower the prices in order to such that people can literally just have enough money to buy it. I do not think we lack for a desire for our product, but we do lack for affordability, and so we have to improve the affordability of our products, so they are not out of reach of people. We want to bring them more in reach over time, but also improve our cost of production. Obviously, we get, hopefully, a little bit better every year. Sometimes a lot better, and in terms of margins, all of these margins are going to look pretty comically small when you factor in autonomy."
Thank you very much. The fourth question from institutionals is at what point do you expect to have enough internal or external battery capacity to start ramping up stationary storage deployments again?,"Yes. We’re ramping up stationary storage a lot. So I mean, it’s approximately doubling. We expect it to approximately double next year, so that’s pretty good, and hopefully we can accelerate that in years to come."
"And approximately doubling it this year, too. So the growth is-","Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, if you just keep doubling things, pretty soon, you hit the mass of the universe, and we’ll need to start turning Jupiter into cells."
And the last question from institutionals is manufacturing is hard. Delays happen. What contingencies do you have in place to ensure the bottlenecks that you might encounter while renting internal cell production will not preclude you from your ability to hit your Model Y production volume targets in Berlin and Texas?,"Yeah. So I think we’re trying to de-risk to 2021 so that there’s almost no dependency on our internal cell production. It’s very, very small."
"Yeah. So I think we’re trying to de-risk to 2021 so that there’s almost no dependency on our internal cell production. It’s very, very small.","… production. It’s very, very small. The internal cell production will help us ramp in ’22, but we’re not dependent on it for ’21."
"And to de-risk the manufacturing system itself, that was one of the reasons why we located our pilot production facility here in Fremont, so we can rapidly iterate on manufacturing scale-up challenges, provide rapid feedback to the design of both the product and the equipment.","Yeah, and our pilot line is pretty big as pilot lines go. It will be in the top 10 cell factories on Earth, I believe."
Yeah. That’s true.,"Subscale one. Yeah, so …"
"Hi, everybody. Just wanted to ask about the targets from your Battery Day. Looked like you could be approaching something like 20 million vehicles by 2030 if you hit those goals. Could you maybe share with us a little bit more of a midterm target, like where would you be by 2025? And maybe give us a little bit more insight into the investment required to get there, just to put that extra $2 billion to $2.5 billion per year into context.","Yeah. I mean I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through the next financial is that if things are doubling every year or even just growing 50%, then if you shift plus/minus one year, it has a huge effect on the number.It sounds like, wow, you either massively exceeded or massively undershot, but it’s actually, what’s going on is a giant S-curve. So a whole bunch of pretty big S-curves that integrate into a gigantic S-curve, so that’s why it’s difficult to predict the middle. And I’m not saying for sure we’ll hit 20 million vehicles, but it does seem like a good goal to have because that would mean that we’re replacing 1% of the global fleet per year."
"Yeah.

And I’m not saying for sure we’ll hit 20 million vehicles, but it does seem like a good goal to have because that would mean that we’re replacing 1% of the global fleet per year.","And it’s difficult to say that we’re … Are we really changing the world if we’re not switching out 1% of the global fossil fuel vehicles? I mean, I’m not sure that we can make that argument unless we change at least 1% of the vehicles per year. So that’s where the 20 million vehicle per year comes from. It’s like 1% of two billion vehicles, which is the global fleet currently. The global fleet is growing, so probably will be a bit bigger in the future. So it’s hard to say. It’s like map an S-curve to a 20 million vehicle target in 2030 and move a slider around and see what that number looks like. That will give you about as much insight as we have."
"Okay. And just secondly, if solid-state lithium metal were to become viable, could you just maybe just pass along your perspective on that, and would you be able to repurpose most of what you’re putting into place for changes in technology?","Yeah. I mean answering the first part, the cell production system is fairly agnostic on anode, cathode, electrolyte, separator, that kind of thing. We could change, and we will change and upgrade all aspects of the cell. And we could, for example, make ion phosphate or nickel manganese or something like that. It’s quite adaptable. So I wouldn’t say just too much more about it. The lithium, like a pure lithium anode it’s not as great as it may sound. Yeah, volumetrically, you’re not gaining all that much because if you got nothing, let’s say on the anode side, and you just play out lithium, it’s got to go somewhere, so you’ve got to have room for it."
"Yeah. Lithium is less volumetrically dense in the pure metal form than it is intercalated into silicon, so it’s kind of hard to understand, but that’s the truth. And then, as we showed in our presentation, the total anode cost that we’re talking about is only $1 or $2 per kilowatt hour, so the value of like removing the anode material isn’t super high either. So yes, I totally agree, Elon.","Yeah, exactly. But if it should turn out that a pure lithium anode is the right move, that would be no problem."
"Thanks so much, guys. Yeah, you’re talking about in-sourcing a number of processes. Can you talk a little bit about which processes you’re moving in-house and the equipment that you’re planning to make yourself versus some of the equipment that you’d be buying from other folks?","Sorry. Are you talking about for cell manufacturing or something, or-"
"Well, cell manufacturing for sure, as well on the molds that you talked about, in terms of the CapEx budget that you mentioned earlier, talking about the number of processes coming in-house and which equipment pieces you’re planning to make yourself versus buying?","Okay. Well, I mean, Tesla is absurdly vertically integrated compared to other auto companies or basically most any company. We have a massive amount of internal manufacturing technology that we build ourselves. We literally make the machine. In fact, we design, so like, okay, what are the things we want to make, design a machine that will make that thing, then we make the machine. This makes it quite difficult to copy Tesla, which we’re not actually all that opposed to people copying us, but it’s quite difficult because you can’t do catalog engineering. You can’t just, “I’ll pick up the supplier catalog. I’ll get one of this machines, one of that machine. Bingo, I’m now Tesla.” There is no catalog. What catalog? So we made the machine that made the machine that made the machine."

So we made the machine that made the machine that made the machine.","Now, we don’t want to get carried away here, and quite frankly, we would like to outsource less. That would be great, because then if we could outsource … If we take something that we’re doing and outsource it, then we could take those people, and we’re going to have them do something else. But yeah, it’s like we’re just making a crazy amount of machinery internally. Tesla is not well understood. If you just walk around the factory, you’d just get a sense for it. And, yeah, I don’t know if this is like a smart move, But I just know, hey, if we’re trying to make progress and nobody’s got the machines that we need, we’ve got to make it, so we do."
"Okay. And then the second question is really around the balance sheet has really changed. You guys have run awfully lean, and you’ve got a lot more cushion at this point, and obviously, there’s opportunities around insurance to drive out some of the cost of ownership as well as financials. How are you guys thinking about that as you move into trying to accelerate demand a little bit and your ability to leverage your access to capital and enable some of those other products? Is that changing from where you’ve been in the past?","Yes. I mean, something like insurance is a good example of a product that’s basically made by our internal applications team. So we made the insurance product and connect it to the car, look at the data, calculate the risk. This is all basically internal software application. It’s pretty low capital but has very high return. I don’t know. We’re trying to spend money at the fastest rate that we can possibly spend it and not waste it. That’s our current plan, and so it’s quite hard to spend money without wasting it. We’re really just trying to not waste too much of it, frankly. We will certainly waste some of it, but trying to not to waste too much of it. This is very difficult. But otherwise, we just try to spend money as quickly as possible in a way that is sensible and yields more value than it costs."
"Hey, Elon. A question on LIDAR. If LIDAR were totally free, would you want to use it in your cars near term? Would that tech significantly help Tesla on the training of your neural network for FSD?","I mean, totally free, probably not. I think even if it was free, we wouldn’t put it on."
"Okay. Let’s follow up then. Amazon appears to be investing and building an autonomous or electric transport network of some ilk through some organic investments, but also Zoox, Aurora, Rivian, etc. What advice would you give Jeff Bezos in his endeavor?","Well, I don’t know how much he cares about this, but I guess, he sure is investing a lot of money in it. I mean, I think you obviously, if you care about autonomy, you need to focus on vision because the entire road system is based on passive optical, so you have to solve passive optical to have a self-driving system that is a generalized solution. And once you solve passive optical, you’ve solved self-driving, so why bother with anything else?"
"Thanks, Elon.",Welcome.
"Hey. Thanks a lot for taking my question. A very simple one. You haven’t talked that much about like the Cybertruck today, and I was wondering how like the ramp of that product is looking like, when we should see the product hitting the road, and how fast do you expect to ramp volumes? Then I have a quick follow-up.","Sure. I was in the studio actually last Friday with Franz and the team just going over just sort of some improvements to the Cybertruck. Generally, at Tesla, we really aim to make the car that is delivered better than the car that is unveiled, because it always drove me crazy. Car companies would unveil these awesome looking cars, and you’re like, “Great. Can’t wait until they make that,” and then the car they actual make is much worse, and it’s really disappointing? So, man, we always want to make the car that we deliver be better than the car we unveil, and that’s the goal with the Cybertruck. So there’s a lot of small improvements compared to what was unveiled. I think it’s going to be better than what we showed and yeah, it’s cool."

It’s never been done before, so there’ll probably be some challenges along the way. And obviously, something that’s extremely high hardness and difficult to scratch or dent is also difficult to form, so there’s manufacturing challenges there. That’s why it’s so cleaner, although it also looks good, I think, from a cleaner standpoint. Yeah, if all goes well, we’ll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries toward the end of next year. Yeah, so it’s difficult to predict. I’d say there’s probably a lot of deliveries in ’22 and some deliveries toward the end of next year if things go well."
"Okay. And now I’m trying to get a sense of how next year is going to look like. So if I look at your production capacity at the end of this year, it’s going to be almost 850,000 units on an annualized basis, and you’re going to increase capacity in Shanghai, open Berlin. You say today you would open Austin as well, so you’re probably going to end the year above one million units. And so am I right thinking next year we should expect to deliver somewhere between 840,000 and one million cars during the year?","Yes. Go ahead, Zach."
"Yeah, we’ll provide guidance on 2021 after next earnings call.","I mean, it’s in that vicinity. Yeah.. You’re not far off."
"Did you mean a question on the Semi, and if you could just walk us through the development of mega chargers, platooning, and maybe just how you think about autonomy for Tesla Semi and how you envision it impacting the broader trucking industry beyond just EV.","Oh, well actually Jerome, do you want to answer that?"
"So there is no usable or efficient time wasted for charging the Semi, that’s the goal. We’re working with other parties to make sure that there is a standard infrastructure that will be able to be deployed for all customers. Probably all I can say at this point, yeah. [crosstalk 00:03:07].","Sorry, go ahead."
"And just, we’re not working in isolation. Yeah. We’re trying to… We have to invent it because it doesn’t exist, but we’re trying to invent something that could be helpful for everybody.","Yeah, just a note on the sort of Semi. The Semi does consume a lot of cells. So it’s a ‘four to six times’ more than a passenger vehicle. [inaudible 00:00:51:34]. Five-ish times. So if we are cell constrained, it’s simple to ramp up the Semi because there’s no cells."
"Yeah, just a note on the sort of Semi. The Semi does consume a lot of cells. So it’s a ‘four to six times’ more than a passenger vehicle. [inaudible 00:00:51:34]. Five-ish times. So if we are cell constrained, it’s simple to ramp up the Semi because there’s no cells.","So we need to solve the cell constraint before ramping Semi to a significant volume. That’s the only real constraint on Semi progress. And we found over and over again, we just kept running into cell production limitations, and then we’re just taking things out of one pocket and putting them in another. So we just need more cells so that we can do more stationary storage, more vehicles, more vehicle lines [inaudible 00:04:17], we need more cells."
"That makes sense. A question, just, if you think about, you’ve talked about Robotaxi, and how you think that’s going to impact kind of humans moving around. How do you think about Semi impacting freight longer term? I mean, is this something that is nice to have and a compliment to all of your tech in a new market, or do you think that this could be a material business?","I think it’s a very material for sure. Really long term, all transported will go autonomous. Yeah. Horses are already autonomous, but all transport will go autonomous. Yeah, so including Semi. So it’ll be pretty significant."
The technology that we’re putting in Semi is identical to what we’re putting in the other vehicles.,Yeah. Just bigger and more motors.
"Hey, thanks for taking my question. Hey, Elon, what do you think the biggest structural issue is with the let’s call it old school [inaudible 00:53:41] or one or two of the structural issues for them not getting their act together and catching it up with you? And then you mentioned what we want the world to look like ahead of us. What do you envision that is like? Just Tesla or Tesla and Rivian, or what? Thanks.","Well, I do think there will be other car companies. I don’t think we’re going to be the only one. So I mean, the thing is that, what other car companies do even in the auto segment is quite a small subset of what Tesla does. So Tesla, we design and build [inaudible 00:06: 31]. So we’re designing and building so much more of the car than other OEMs."

So it’s not very adventurous and it basically ends up like all the products end up looking the same because they’re going to the same suppliers.

And then we also have to create our sales and service and distribution system and I don’t know, something on the report 40 countries. Somewhere, it will be over a hundred countries. Whereas the other car companies do not own their sales in service and distribution."

So it’s like comparing Tesla to other car companies, like just comparing just really one facet or dimension of Tesla. We’re like maybe 10% in common with other car companies?"
"Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I’ve got two. The first one to me is trying to understand your business model for stationary storage, have your thoughts on it. I mean, there are two broad directions to me, one is selling hardware, which is a bit of a cost plus business. And I’m just wondering if there’s an opportunity where Tesla could actually share into the savings that utilities in particular could be able to achieve in like great stabilization. The information I was able to get on your business in Australia a few years ago, suggest that given the savings that are achieved, your hardware could have been sold at a higher price. I’m just wondering if you can share the views on where this is going.","Yeah, I think you are probably right about that. I mean RJ and Zack, what do you guys think?"
"Okay. Thank you. And the followup question I had was during the battery day, you talked about the cell’s vehicle integration approach. It’s very interesting and when I think about it, it looks like it means that the skateboard design that Tesla pioneered and many of your followers are using is going to become obsolete, or am I not thinking about it the right way?","It will be obviously longterm, yes. I mean, several years from now, it’s not like existing cars stop having value. It’s just that if you have a structural pack where the pack is contributing a structural value to the car, because of the stuff like the composite honeycomb effect of get our share of transfer between an upper and lower plate, then anything that doesn’t do that it’s going to have to duplicate hardware."

And then the same goes for the front and rear castings. We’re trying to make the car like you would make a toy. If you had a toy model car then it’s got to be real cheap and look great.

And then the same goes for using the energy storage, the battery, as a structure, which is done for aircraft wings and for rockets. The early rockets and aircraft, they had a separate aeroshell from propellant tanks or fuel tanks, and then they realized that doesn’t make sense and you’ve got to have your fuel tank in wing shape, or you got to have your propellant tanks in the shape of the body of the rocket for example."

"Thank you very much. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for the Q and A today. Appreciate all your great questions and we’ll speak to you again in about three months. Thank you. Goodbye.",Thank you.
"We will now continue with the company update and year in review. And it’s my pleasure to introduce Tesla co-founder and CEO, Mr. Elon Musk.","Everyone.

I think starting from in terms of our ability to create a …,"In terms of our ability to create a factory, huge kudos to the Tesla Shanghai team for being able to go from literally a dirt pile to volume production in 15 months. It’s like, damn. Yeah. And I think something that’s really quite noteworthy here is Tesla’s the only foreign manufacturer to have a hundred percent owned factory in China. So this is often not well understood or not appreciated, but to have the only hundred percent owned foreign factory in China is a really big deal, and it’s paying huge dividends here. So we really wouldn’t have the results that we have had this year without the great efforts of the Tesla China team, so I’m super appreciative of that, and we’ll see the Shanghai factory continue to scale quite a bit from where it is right now. I think we really could expect that to be, over time, a factory that produces over a million vehicles a year."

So we also reached in the past year of volume production of the Model Y, and this was the smoothest launch that we’ve ever had, so I think we’re definitely getting better at a new vehicle launches and building factories and scaling production. As you’ve heard me say before, the hardest thing is scaling production, especially of a new technology. It’s insanely difficult. Making a prototype is relatively easy, and if I think, like, what is the real achievement of Tesla in sort of car company terms, it’s like it wasn’t making sort of exciting prototypes. It was that Tesla was really the first company in about a century in the U.S., the first U.S. company in the U.S. to reach volume production and be sustainably profitable. The crazy thing is this has really not happened in a hundred years. That’s the actual super hard part, and we now have four vehicles in volume production, S3XY.

I mean, to do this in extremely difficult times against a wide range of adverse circumstances was insanely hard, but we got it done, and I think the future is looking I think, very promising from a sort of an annual profitability standpoint. So in order to sort of do well financially, you really need economies of scale, and you need ideally the best technology, and I think we’ve had the best technology for a while, but now we are also achieving economies of scale, and we’re also rapidly improving autonomy, which is a massive value add to each car. So, I think the value of Tesla is going to be like total, just on the vehicle side, total vehicles produced times the value of autonomy. That’s a way to think about the future value of Tesla."

This is really important for growth, and a key element here is tightening up the time from when a car is ordered to when it is built and delivered. So for a company that is growing rapidly, it’s extremely important to tighten the supply chain and to have, from when parts arrive, put it into a car very quickly and deliver the car very quickly to the customer. And if you can do that inside soft of your payables timeline, then the faster you grow, the more cash you have. Or conversely, if you’re unable to do it within your payables timeline, the faster you grow, the less money you will have, which is obviously bad for capital intensive situation.

When you add active safety into that, it’s even better, so it’s really … If safety is important to you, which obviously it is, the safest car you could drive is a Tesla. So I think some people aren’t aware of this, but it’s really safety is paramount. It is actually the number one design objective when we build a Tesla is safety."

Autopilot functionality continues to improve, and you can see it in the safety report that we publish every quarter. It’s just getting better and better. The U.S. average for collisions is at roughly 2.1 per million miles, and with autopilot engaged, it’s 0.3. I mean, this is a profound difference, really massive, and this will get even better. So we’re confident that over time we can get the probability of an accident, especially the probability of injury, to 10 times better than the industry average, like an order of magnitude better. So that’s just a lot of lives saved and a lot of injuries avoided, so that’s a huge priority for us."

I’m driving … As a matter of course, I’ve always done this. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build of autopilot, and so I sort of have insight into what is going on. Previously about a couple of years ago, we were kind of stuck in a local maximum, so we’re improving, but the improvements kind of started tailing off and just not getting where they needed to be. I call this sort of getting trapped in a local maximum, and so we had to do a fundamental rewrite of the entire autopilot software stack and all of the labeling software as well."

So it basically made it sort of in some cases impossible to label, and the labels had a lot of errors. Now with our new labeling tools, we label it in video, so we actually label entire video segments in the system, so you get basically a surround video thing to label with the surround video and with time. So it’s now taking all cameras simultaneously and looking at how the image has changed over time and labeling that, and then the sophistication of the neural nets in the car and the overall logic in the car has improved dramatically."

It’s profound. So, yeah. Anyway, so you’ll see it. It’s just like a hell of a step change, but because we had to rewrite everything, labeling software, just the entire code base, it took us quite a while. The sort of new … I call it like 4D in the sense that it’s three dimensions plus time. It’s just taken us a while to rewrite everything, and so you’ll see what it’s like. It’s amazing. Yeah. It’s just clearly going to work."

I think manufacturing is underappreciated in general, and the difficulty of designing the machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself. So the designing, like making a Model 3 or Model Y or Cybertruck truck prototype is really quite trivial compared to designing the factory that makes it, especially if it’s new technology, and you want to use new manufacturing methods. It’s just at least 10 to 100 times harder to do the factory than the prototype, and that’s why you see a lot of companies out there or startups they’ll bring out a prototype, but they just can’t get it over the hump for who manufacturing, because manufacturing of new technology especially is the hardest thing by fa.

That’s the true metric of success. It matters if sustainable energy happens faster or slower, and so that’s really how I think about Tesla and how we should assess our progress.

"Hi, folks. That was great. We’re going to take a short break before we begin the Battery Day event, so stay tuned. If you’re local and here in the audience today, you can feel free to get out of the cars and stretch your legs, but try to stay near the cars, because we’re going to begin properly in a little bit. See you soon. (silence).",[inaudible 01:40:28].
"Hello, everyone.",Great. Should you start?
"Sure. Thanks, Elon. Hi. I’m Drew Baglino, SVP of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla, and I’m incredibly excited to talk about what we’ve been doing with batteries here at Tesla.",Great. So let’s see. You’ve got the clicker?
"I’ve got the clicker, yeah.","Okay. Let’s … Yeah. I’ll take it at first, perhaps."
Sure.,"So obviously the issues we’re facing are very serious with climate change, and we’re experiencing these issues on a day-to-day basis. It’s incredibly important that we accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. Time really matters. This presentation is about accelerating the time to sustainable energy."
"So obviously the issues we’re facing are very serious with climate change, and we’re experiencing these issues on a day-to-day basis. It’s incredibly important that we accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. Time really matters. This presentation is about accelerating the time to sustainable energy.","So the past five years were the hottest on record. We have what looks like a wall for CO2 PPM. It’s obviously … This time is not like the past. It’s really important that we take action. Running this climate experiment is insane, so …"
"Especially when it’s just a transitory one, anyway.",Yes.
We’re going to run out of these fossil fuels. Let’s just move to the future and not run this experiment any longer. Yeah.,Talk a bit louder.
You got it.,"Okay. So anyway, there is a lot of good …"
"Okay. So anyway, there is a lot of good …","There is a lot of good news though. A lot of people may not be aware that that wind and solar comprise 75% of new electricity capacity in the US this year. So this is really major. So the grid is going sustainable very quickly. Now, it’s also worth noting that the length of time that power plants lasts is on the order of 25 years. So even if a hundred percent of energy generation was sustainable, it will still take 25 years to convert the grid. And it’s also worth noting that in the past 10 years, power production from coal has dropped in half. So it went from 46% of electricity in 2010 to 23% in 2020. So this is a massive improvement. So good things are happening on a lot of levels. We just need to go faster."

So good things are happening on a lot of levels. We just need to go faster.","So Tesla’s contribution, we’ve delivered over a million electric vehicles, 26 billion electric miles driven, and many gigawatt hours of stationary batteries, 17 terawatt hours of solar generated. So I think solar is sometimes underweighted at Tesla, but it is a massive part of our future. The three parts of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, storage, and electric vehicles. So we intend to play a significant role in all three. So to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, we must produce more EVs that need to be affordable and a lot more energy storage, while building factories faster and with far less investment. So goal number one is a terawatt hour scale battery production. So tera is the new giga. And a terawatt is a thousand times more than a gigawatt. So we used to talk in terms of gigawatts, in the future, we’ll be talking in terms of terawatt hours. So this is what’s needed in order to transition the world to sustainability."
"Yeah, and you can see it’s… We’re talking about a hundred X growth in batteries for electric vehicles to achieve this mission. And we are going to get there. It’s just a matter of how fast. And our intention is to accelerate it.","Yeah, you basically need on the order of roughly 10 terawatt hours a year of battery production to transition the global fleet of vehicles to electric."
"And the average vehicle lasts 15 years. So we’re talking about 150 terawatt hours give or take to transition the whole electric, all vehicles of all types, to electric.","Yeah. So it’s a lot of batteries, basically. And so-"
"Yeah. And then on the grid side, we have a similar mountain to climb, 1600 times growth from today’s grid batteries to go a hundred percent renewable on the grid and to take all of the existing heating fossil fuel uses in homes and businesses, a hundred percent electric.","Yeah. And this number I think might grow even more. As the world economy matures, and as countries with high populations industrialize, we could see this number be even more. But let’s say it’s like roughly 20 to 25 terawatt hours per year sustained for 15 to 25 years to transition the world to renewable. This is a lot."
Yeah.,"So today’s batteries cannot scale fast enough. They’re just too small. For Giga Nevada, 150 gigawatt hours per year is what we probably expect to make out of there. But this is really pretty small in the grand scheme of things. That’s only 0.15 terawatt hours. And it costs too much."
We would need 135 fully built out in Nevada Giga factories to achieve 20 terawatt hours a year. It’s not scalable enough of a solution. We need a dramatic rethink of the cell manufacturing system to scale as fast as we can and should.,"Yeah, and I think we should view this as more than just a question of money. Money is sort of an ethereal thing, but it’s really the amount of effort. You have a certain amount of effort in terms of people and machines, and depending on how efficient that effort is, for a given amount of effort, you want the most amount of batteries. So it’s not just the question of well, if we have $2 trillion, tomorrow you could make this. It’s not that easy. You actually need to organize a massive number of people, build a lot of machines, build the machines that make the machines. And so it’s incredibly important to have that effort yield the most number of batteries."
"Yeah, and I think we should view this as more than just a question of money. Money is sort of an ethereal thing, but it’s really the amount of effort. You have a certain amount of effort in terms of people and machines, and depending on how efficient that effort is, for a given amount of effort, you want the most amount of batteries.

You actually need to organize a massive number of people, build a lot of machines, build the machines that make the machines. And so it’s incredibly important to have that effort yield the most number of batteries.","So, and then goal two, obviously we need to make more affordable cars. I think one of the things that troubles me the most is that we don’t yet have a truly affordable car, and that is something that we will make in the future. But in order to do that, we’ve got to get the cost of batteries down. We’ve got to make, and we’ve got to be better at manufacturing. And we need to do something about this curve. The curve of the cost per kilowatt hour of batteries is not improving fast enough. So we’ve given this a lot of thought over many years to say, okay, how can we radically improve the cost per kilowatt hour curve? It’s been somewhat flattening out actually in recent years."
"Yeah. I mean, early growth was promising, but you can see we’re kind of plateauing. So that’s what’s motivating us to rethink how cells are produced and designed.","Yeah, exactly. So yeah. And EV market share is growing, but EVs still aren’t accessible to all. And you can see, as you Drew were saying, it’s like starting to flatten out a little bit because the rate of improvement of the affordability of cars is just not fast enough. So that’s why we’ve got Battery Day."
"Yeah. To make the best cars in the world, we designed vehicles in factories from the ground up. Next. And now we do this for batteries as well.","Yeah. It’s weird, the slides don’t show up quite right here. What shows up on the screen is not quite what shows up there."
"Oh, okay.",It’s different.
Yeah. I think it’s because that’s… Yeah.,"That one’s current, supposed to be current. Whatever."
"So let’s get started. We have a plan to have the cost per kilowatt hour. And it’s not a plan that rests on a single innovation, some research project that will never see the light of day. It’s a plan that has taken creative engineering and industrialization across every facet of what makes a cell into a battery pack, from raw material to the finished thing. And we’re going to go through that plan with you today, step-by-step, and build up how we get to these goals and how we accelerate this transition and make our vehicles and our grid batteries more affordable.","Yeah. I mean, we basically thought through every element of the battery, or almost every element. There are a few more elements that we won’t get to today, but we will get to in the future."
"Watch what happens as we, there we go, discharge the cell. Got lithium moving from anode to cathode. And then the reverse when we charge the cell, lithium moving from cathode to anode across the separator. This is the basic of what makes all lithium-ion batteries, no matter what the form factor is. And when we look at what’s happened today, at least in our products, we’ve moved from the 18650 form factor to the 2170 form factor through great collaboration with our partners, Panasonic, new partners like LG and CATL and probably others in the future.","Actually, slight note on why is the one called 18650, although not on the slide, versus the 2170, is that the first two digits refer to the diameter, and the second two digits refer to the length. So that helps explain what’s up with these weird numbers. But nobody could explain to me why there was an extra zero. So I, so I said, “Okay, well, we’re deleting the zero that nobody can explain in future form factors.” So that’s why it’s technically, it’s like the 18650 bizarrely, but going forward it’s the 2170, because we just got rid of the extra zero because it’s pointless."
"And this was a evolutionary step going from 1865 to 2170, bringing 50% more energy into the cell. But when we look to the ideal cell design, if we were to do it ourselves, we need to go beyond just what we’re looking at us in front of us and study the full spectrum of options. So as you can see, we kind of swept the key figures of merit, how much we can reduce the cost and how much vehicle range increases as we change the outer diameter of the cell. We found a sweet spot somewhere around 46 millimeters. But it’s not just about a bigger form factor. Anybody could make a bigger form factor.","Any fool, any fool could make a bigger form factor. Are we not any fool?"
"Yeah, exactly. There are problems as you make cells larger. In fact, supercharging and thermals in general become really challenging as you make bigger cells. And this was the challenge that our team set our sights on to overcome. And we did, we came up with this tabless architecture that maybe you’ve heard about, that basically removes the thermal problem from the equation and allows us to go to the absolute lowest cost form factor and the simplest manufacturing process. And this is what we mean when we talk about tabless. It’s kind of a beautiful thing.","Yeah. That’s what these t-shirts mean, but it’s very esoteric. It was like, nobody could figure it out."
"Yeah, we basically took the existing foils, laser pattered them, and enabled dozens of connections into the active material through this shingled spiral you can see with simpler manufacturing, fewer parts, 50 millimeter versus 250 millimeter electrical path length, which is how we get all the thermal benefits.","Yeah. This is important to appreciate. Basically the distance that that electron has to travel, it’s just much less. So you actually have a shorter path length in a large tabless cell than you have in the smaller cell with tabs. This is a big deal. So even though the cell is bigger, it actually has more power. The power to weight ratio is actually better than the smaller cell with tabs. This is, again, this is quite hard to do it. Nobody’s done it before and it really took a tremendous amount of effort within Tesla engineering to figure out how do we make a frigging tabless cell and have it actually work and then connect that to the top cap. There’s a whole bunch of things that we’re keeping a little secret sauce here that we’re not telling everything, but-"
"Sometimes what’s elegant and simple is still hard. And it took us a lot of trials, but we’re happy where we ended up.","Yeah. I mean, everything is simple in recollection, after you… it’s hard until it’s discovered and then it’s simple. So anyway, there’s a lot of really cool things going on that enable tabless. And it was really due to a really great engineering team. Drew and the rest of the team had done amazing work in achieving this tabless construction. I think it may sort of sound a bit silly to some people, but for people that really know cells, this is a massive breakthrough."
For cylindricals to be able to get rid of the tabs dramatically simplifies winding and coding. And has an awesome thermal and performance benefit.,"Yeah. Just to elaborate on that a bit, it’s like when the cell is going through the system, it has to keep stopping where all the tabs are. So you can’t do a continuous motion production if you have tabs. You have to keep stopping and then there’s a rate at which you can start and stop and accelerate again and it really slows down the rate of production. And then sometimes you get the tabs wrong and you also lose a little bit of active area. It’s really a huge pain in the ass to have tabs from a production standpoint."
"Yes. And so when we put it all together and go to our new 80 millimeter length, 4680 we call this a new cell design, we get five times the energy with six times the power and enable 16% range increase, just form factor alone.","Yeah. So these… Yeah. It’s pretty great. And just to clarify, when we see these plus 16% or whatever the percentage rate increase is, these are the amounts due just to that particular innovation. So we’ll list a whole bunch of innovations and then when you add them up, you get a total improvement in energy density and cost. But these numbers are what refer to just this thing."
"Yeah. And I want to stress, this is not just a concept or a rendering. We’re starting to ramp up manufacturing of these cells at our pilot 10 gigawatt hour production facility, just around the corner.","Yeah. So. Yeah. It’s a video of some of what’s going on in the plant. Now. I mean, to be clear, it will take about a year to reach the 10 gigawatt hour capacity. So this is important to appreciate. When you build a factory, there’s a certain capacity that you design to, and then it takes some period of time to actually achieve that capacity. So I would say it’s probably about a year before we get to the 10 gigawatt hour annualized rate with the pilot plant. And this is just a pilot plant. The actual production plants will be more on the order of maybe 200 gigawatt hours, maybe more over time."
"You’ve got mixing where the powders are mixed with either a water or a solvent, solvents for the cathode. That mix then goes into a large coat and dry oven where the slurry is coated onto the foil, huge ovens, tens of meters long, dried, and that solvent then has to be recovered. You can see the solvent recovery system. And then finally the coated foil is compressed to the final density. And when you’re looking at this, you’re like, wow, that’s a lot of equipment for one step, especially when you consider that little spec next to the coating oven is a person. This is serious iron involved in making batteries. Wouldn’t it be great if we could skip that solvent step, which is one of those dig a ditch, and then fill it kind of things where you put the solvent in and then take it out and recycle it, and just go straight to a dry mix to coat? And that’s what the dry process really is about. And in the most basic form, you can see it here on a benchtop, literally powder into film, as simple as that.","I mean, it’s hard actually, just to be clear. If this was easy, everyone would do it. It’s not like dry coating electrode is actually easy. It’s actually very hard to do what appears to be a simple thing. And it’s worth noting, we did acquire Maxwell a little over a year ago, I guess, and certainly a good company and everything, but the dry coating they had was like, it’s like sort of, I would call proof of concept. Since the acquisition. We’ve actually ramped the machine that does dry coating four times. So revision full post acquisition of the machine, and there’s still a lot of work to do. So I would not say this is completely in the bag. It’s still a lot of work to do. And as you grow, as you scale, go from benchtop to lab to pilot to volume production, there are actually major issues that you encounter at every level. It’s not like you make something work on your bench and bingo, now you can make a bazillion of it."
Absolutely.,It’s insanely difficult to scale up. Yeah.
"Yeah, but if you do scale it up, what you saw before becomes this. So you can see the motivation. A 10 times reduction in footprint, a 10 times reduction in energy and a massive reduction in investment. But as Elon was saying, simple is hard.","Yeah. I mean, to be clear, I would like to not say that right now, it just totally working. It’s close to working, but it’s not, even now at the pilot plant level, it is close to working. It’s fair to say probably it does work, but with not a good, not a high yield."
"Yeah. We’re still ironing out the kinks, but we’ve made tens of thousands of cells, thousands of kilometers of electrode. I mean, we are on the fourth generation of the equipment so we’ve learned a lot along the way. I mean, it is super demanding because every atom has its place if you want to deliver the energy density and the cycle life and the supercharging. But we’re confident that we will get there, but it will be a lot of work along that.","There’s a clear path to success, but a ton of work between here and there. But this is a really profound improvement. Again, for people that know battery manufacturing, this is gigantic. We’ll probably be on machine revision six or seven by the time we do large scale production. The rate at which the machines are being improved is extremely rapid. Literally every three or four months, there’s a new rev."
"Yeah. And beyond the electrode, we continue to innovate on every other process steps. So let’s talk a little bit about assembly, which is next. The key to a high-performing assembly line is accomplishing processes while in motion, continuous motion. And thinking of the line as a highway, max velocity down the highway, no start and stop, no city driving.","Exactly, no stop lights and traffic lights sort of thing. You want the highway."
"You want the highway. And together with our internal design team that makes this equipment and designs this equipment, we coupled thinking about how to make the best cell with thinking about how to make the best equipment so that we could accomplish the fastest parts per minute rates on all of these tools. And through all of that development, we were able to get to the point where we can implement assembly lines, one line, 20 gigawatt hours, seven times increase in output per line. And when you’re thinking about scalability and pure effort, having one line be seven X the capability is just effort multiplying.",Yeah. So you can sort of think about the sort of the fundamental physics of a factory or something. I think it’s actually quite a lot like the rocket equation where you’ve got basically the rocket equation you’ve got your exhaust velocity and then the log of [end 02:05:24] masses. So it’s basically saying how fast are things going and what percentage of the factory volume is doing useful work? And conveyance does not count as useful work.
Only the value added steps.,"Yeah. If you break the factory down into cubic meter sections and say… or smaller. Could be like one liter sections, and say, “Is a majority of this volume of doing useful work?” You’d be astounded at how bad most factories are. They’d be like maybe two or 3%, including our factory in Fremont. So I think it’s possible to get to at least 10 times that of volumetric efficiency. So more like 30%ish, maybe more, and be 10x better, which means the factory can be 10 times smaller. And then the other thing is how fast are things going through the factory? It’s like speed and density. A factory that’s moving at say twice the speed of another factory is equivalent to two factories basically. And the company that will be successful is the company that with one factory can accomplish what other companies take two or three or four factories to do. So this is what we’re trying to do here is say, okay, how do we, with one factory achieve what maybe five or even 10 factories would normally be required to achieve?"
"And the vertical integration with the machine design teams at Grohmann and Hibar and others allows us to really accomplish that because we don’t have any of these edge conditions between one piece of equipment and another, we can design the entire machine to be one machine and remove all of these unnecessary steps.","Yeah. I mean, basically Tesla is aiming to be the best at manufacturing of any company on Earth. This is the thing that’s actually most important in the long run I think, just from a company standpoint and from basically achieving sustainability as fast as possible. But I think also for long-term competitiveness, eventually every car company will have long range electric cars. Eventually every company will have autonomy, I think, but not every company will be a great at manufacturing. Tesla will be absolutely head and shoulders above anyone else in manufacturing, that is our goal."
"Manufacturing is hard and hard problems are fun to solve. Okay. Now let’s talk about formation. In a typical cell factory, formation represents 25% of the investment. And what is formation? Is it’s charging and discharging cells and verifying the quality of the cell. It turns out we’ve charged and discharged billions and billions of cells in our vehicles so we know a thing or two about that. The typical formation set up is you charge and discharge each cell individually. In our car, we charge thousands of cells at once. And we took our principal and our power electronics, leveraging Powerwall vehicle battery management systems and others to dramatically improve the formation equipment cost-effectiveness and density. 86% reduction in formation investment, 75% reduction in footprint. You want to take this one?",Sure. So essentially what this translates to based on what we know today is about a 75% reduction in the investment per kilowatt hour. Or gigawatt hour. It’s just basically four times better than the current state of the art to the best of our knowledge. And I think there’s probably room to improve even beyond that.
Definitely.,"Definitely. Yeah. So we’re able to, from a volume standpoint, actually get what, in a smaller form factor than Giga Nevada, we’re able to get many times the cell output. So you can see basically we can get a terawatt hour in less space than it took to make a gigawatt hour, 150 gigawatt hours. So this is pretty profound. I would actually not have thought this was possible several years ago, that we could actually get to a terawatt scale in less space than what we currently envisioned for doing 150 gigawatt hours."
"Yes. Simpler accelerates terawatt scale. And that’s what we need to do to accelerate our mission. And as Elon said, we’re going to try to even improve on this as we push towards our goals, which are…","Yeah. So this is just talking about Tesla internal cell production. As I tweeted out earlier, we will continue to use our cell suppliers, Panasonic and LG and CATL. And so this is a hundred gigawatt hours supplemental to what we buy from suppliers. And yeah, essentially, this does reduce our weighted average cost of a sale, but it allows us to make a lot more cars and a lot more stationary storage. And then long-term, we’re expecting to make on the order of a 3000 gigawatt hours or three terawatt hours per year. I think we’ve got a good chance of achieving this actually before 2030, but I’m highly confident that we could do it by 2030."
"When you look at the size of that factory on the previous page, it really shows how enabling all of these advancements are in achieving a three terawatt hour goal by 2030. And not only is all of that manufacturing innovation fantastic for enabling scale, it’s also an additional 18% reduction in dollar per kilowatt hour at the battery pack level.","But wait, there’s more."
"But wait, there’s more. So we have a manufacturing system, we’ve got a cell design. What are the active materials we’re going to put in that cell design? Let’s talk about the anode first. Let’s talk about silicon. Why is silicon awesome? It’s awesome because it’s the most abundant element in the Earth’s crust after oxygen, which means it’s everywhere. It’s sand.",Sand is silicon dioxide.
"And it happens to store nine times more lithium than graphite, which is the typical anode material in lithium-ion batteries today. So why isn’t everybody using it? The main reason is because the challenge with silicon is that it expands four X when fully charged with lithium. And basically all of that expansion stress on the particle, the particles start cracking, they start electrically isolating, you lose capacity. The energy retention of the battery starts to fade. And it also gumps up with a passivation layer that has to keep reforming as the particles expand.","Yeah. Basically with silicon, the cookie crumbles and gets gooey. That’s basically what happens."
"Good analogy. And current approaches to solve this, which exist, I mean, we have silicon in the cars that you’re all in right now, involved highly engineered, expensive materials in the scheme of things. Now they’re still great and they enable some of the benefits of silicon. They just don’t enable all of it and they’re not scalable enough. And you can see some of the things that maybe you’ve heard of, SIO, silicon with carbon, or silicon nanowires. That’s kind of the space right now. What we’re proposing is a step change in capability and a step change in cost. And what that really is is to just go to the raw metallurgical silicon itself, don’t engineer the base metal, just start with that and design for it to expand in how you think of the particle in the electrode design and how you coat it.","Yeah. And I’m not sure if you saw this. Basically a dollar per kilowatt hours basically. If you use simple silicon, it’s dramatically less than even the silicon that is currently used in the batteries that are made today, and you can use a lot more of it."
"The anode would cost, yeah, with this silicon, the anode costs a dollar and 20 cents a kilowatt hour.",Yeah.
"And how does it work? Start with raw metallurgical silicon, stabilize the surface with an elastic ion conducting polymer coating that is applied through a very scalable approach. No chemical vapor deposition, no highly engineered high capacity, high cap ex solutions, and then integrate it into the electrode through a robust network formed out of a highly elastic binder. And in the end, by leveraging this silicon to its potential, we can increase the range of our vehicles by an additional 20%. Just this improvement.",Yeah. It gets cheaper and longer range. Okay.
"Yeah. And when we take that anode cost reduction, we’re looking at another 5% dollar per kilowatt hour reduction at the battery pack level. And there’s more. Let’s talk about cathodes. What is a battery cathode? Cathodes are like bookshelves where the metal, the nickel, the cobalt, the manganese or aluminum is like the shelf, and the lithium is the book. And really what sets apart these different metals is how many books of lithium they can fit on the shelves and how sturdy the shelves are. Cobalt is a-","Sorry, I was going to say it’s tough to exactly figure out what the right analogy is to explain a cathode and anode. But a bookshelf is probably a pretty good one in the sense that you need a stable structure to contain the ions. So you want a structure that does not crumble or get gooey, or basically that that holds its shape in both the cathode and the anode. As you’re moving these ions back and forth, it needs to retain its structure. So if it doesn’t retain a structure, then you lose cycle life and your battery capacity drops very quickly."
"Why increasing nickel is a goal of ours, and really everybody’s in the battery industry. But one of the reasons why cobalt is even used at all is because it is a very stable bookshelf. And the challenge with going to pure nickel is stabilizing that bookshelf with only nickel. And that’s what we’ve been working on with our high nickel cathode development, which has zero cobalt in it, leveraging novel coatings and dopants We can get a 15% reduction in cathode dollar per kilowatt hour.",Yeah. Big deal.
But it’s not just about nickel. You want a?,"Yeah. Sure. So in order to scale, we really need to make sure that we’re not constrained by total nickel availability. I actually spoke with the CEOs of the biggest mining companies in the world and said, “Please make more nickel, this is very important.” And so I think they are going to make more nickel. I think we need to have a kind of a three-tiered approach to batteries."

I think we need to have a kind of a three-tiered approach to batteries.","So starting with iron, that’s kind of like a medium range, and then nickel manganese as sort of a medium plus intermediate and then high nickel for long range applications like Cyber Truck and the semi. Something like a semi-truck, it’s extremely important to have high energy density in order to get long range. And just to give sort of iron up a bit more time, if you look at [inaudible 02:17:37] per kilogram at the cathode level of iron, it looks like nickel’s twice as good, but when you fully consider it at the pack level, everything else taken into account, nickel is about maybe 50 or 60% better than iron."

It’s not as good as nickel, nickel’s like 50 to 60% better, but it’s actually pretty good. Good for stationary storage and for medium range applications where energy density is not paramount. And then, like I said, for intermediate, it’s kind of a nickel manganese, and it’s a relatively straightforward to do a cathode that’s two-thirds nickel one third manganese, which would then allow us to make 50% more cell volume with the same amount of nickel."
"And with very little energy trade-off. Just enough to have, you still want to use 100% nickel for something like a semi-truck, but really not much of a sacrifice at all.",Yeah.
"Here’s a view of the traditional cathode process. Effectively, if you start at the left and you have the metal from the mine, the first thing that happens is the metal from the mine is changed into an intermediate thing called a metal sulfate, because that just happened to be what chemists wanted a long time ago. And then when you’re making the cathode you have to take this intermediate thing called the metal sulfate fate, add chemicals, add a whole bunch of water, a whole bunch of stuff happens in the middle, and at the end you get that little bit of cathode and a whole bunch of wastewater and byproducts.","It’s insanely complicated. It’s a small world journey of, “I am a nickel atom, what happens to me?” And it is crazy. You’re going around the world three times, there’s the moral equivalent of digging the ditch, filling the ditch and digging the ditch again, it’s total madness basically. And these things just grew up, they’re just kind of like legacy things, it’s like how it was done before and then they connected the dots but really didn’t think of the whole thing from a first principle standpoint saying, “How do we get from the nickel ore in the ground to the finished nickel product for a battery?” So we’ve looked at the entire value chain and said, “How can we make this as simple as possible?”"
"And now that we have this process, obviously we’re going to go and start building our own cathode facility in North America and leveraging all of the North American resources that exist for nickel and lithium. And just doing that, just localizing our cathode supply chain and production, we can reduce miles traveled by all the materials that end up in the cathode by 80%, which is huge for cost.","Yeah. To be clear, cathode production would be part of our the Tesla cell production plant. So it would just be basically raw materials coming from the mine and from raw materials in the mine out comes a battery."
"And on that note, the way the lithium ends up in the cell is through the cathode. So then we should obviously on-site lithium conversion as well, which is what we will do using a new process that we’re going to pioneer. That’s a sulfate-free process again, skip the intermediate, 33% reduction in lithium cost, a hundred percent electric facility co-located with the cathode plant.","So it’s important to note that there is a massive amount of lithium on earth. So lithium is not like oil. There’s a massive amount of it, pretty much everywhere. In fact is there’s enough lithium in the United States to convert the entire United States fleet to electric, all the cars in the United States. Like 300 million or something like that. Every vehicle in the United States can be converted to electric using only lithium that is available in the United States."
Discovered today.,"Yeah, what we already know is exist."
People really haven’t even been looking.,"Yeah, people haven’t been trying because it’s just widely available. But it is important to say, “Okay, what is the smartest way to take ores and extract the lithium and do so in an environmentally friendly way?” And we actually discovered… Again, looking at it a first principles physics standpoint, instead of just the way it’s always been done, is we found that we can actually use table salt, sodium chloride, to basically extract the lithium from the ores. Nobody’s done this before, to the best of my knowledge, nobody’s done this. And all the elements are reusable, it’s a very sustainable way of obtaining lithium. And we actually got rights to a lithium clay deposit in Nevada."
"Over 10,000 acres.","Over 10,000 acres. And then the nature of the mining is actually also very environmentally sensitive in that we sort of take a chunk of dirt out of the ground, remove the lithium, and then put the chunk of dirt back where it was. So it will look pretty much the same as before, it will not look like terrible. And yeah, it’ll be nice."
"Simply mix clay with salt, put it in water, salt comes out with the lithium, done.",Yeah. It’s pretty crazy.
Yeah. So we’re really excited about this and there really is enough lithium in Nevada alone to electrify the entire US fleet.,"Yeah, that’s true. Actually, just what’s in Nevada. Basically, there’s so much damn lithium on Earth it’s crazy. It’s one of the most common elements on the planet."
"And eventually, as we said at the beginning, when we get to this steady state 20 terawatt hours per year of production, we will transfer the entire non-renewable fleet of both power plants, home heating and industry heating and vehicles to electric. And at that point, we have an awesome resource in those batteries to recycle, to make new batteries. So we don’t need to do any more mining at that point. And you can see why. The difference in the value of the material coming back from the vehicle versus the ground, you’d always go to the vehicle. And we recycle a hundred percent of our vehicle batteries today. And actually, we are starting our pilot full-scale recycling production at Gigafactory Reno next quarter to continue to develop this process as our recycling returns grow.","To date, it’s been done by third parties, but we think we can recycle the batteries more effectively, especially since our batteries, we’re making the same battery as the thing we’re recycling. Whereas third party recyclers have to consider batteries of all kinds."
"Yeah. And just to think about what this actually means, the recycling resource is always 10 or greater years delayed because batteries last a really long time, but eventually it is the way that all resources will be made available. And that’s why we’re investing in this recycling facility in Nevada.","Yeah. Long-term, new batteries will come from old batteries once the fleet reaches steady state."
"Right. Okay. So we just talked about scaling cathode and recycling, all of the benefits that you just saw are added to this benefit of a 12% reduction in dollars per kilowatt hour at the battery pack level, almost at our half of the cost goal, but there’s one more section. Take it away, Elon.","So there’s an architecture that we’ve been wanting to do at Tesla for a long time, and we’ve finally figured it out. And I think it’s the way that all electric cars in the future will ultimately be made, it’s the right way to do things."
"So there’s an architecture that we’ve been wanting to do at Tesla for a long time, and we’ve finally figured it out. And I think it’s the way that all electric cars in the future will ultimately be made, it’s the right way to do things.","So it starts with having a single piece casting for the front body and the rear body. And in order to do this, we commissioned the largest casting machine that has ever been made. And it’s currently working just over the road at our Fremont plant. It’s pretty sweet. Currently making the entire rear section of the car as a single piece, high pressure die-cast aluminum. And in order to do this, we actually had to develop our own alloy because we wanted a high strength casting alloy that did not require coatings or heat treatment. This is a big deal for castings. Especially with a large casting. If you heat treat it afterwards it tends to deform, it kind of does this like potato chip thing. So it’s very hard to keep a large casting to have its shape."

So that’s a great achievement of our materials team. In fact, in general, we’ve got a lot of advanced materials coming for Tesla, new alloys and materials that have never existed before."

Where the battery for the first time will have dual use. The battery will both have the use as an energy device and as structure. This is absolutely the way things are done. In the early days of aircraft they would carry the fuel tanks as cargo. So the fuel tanks actually were quite difficult to carry. They’re basically worse than cargo, you had to add to kind of bolt them down. It was very difficult. And then somebody said, “Hey, what if we just make the fuel tank in wing shape?” So all modern airplanes, your wing is just a fuel tank in wing shape. This is absolutely the way to do it. And then the fuel tanks serves this dual structure, and it’s no longer cargo. It’s fundamental to the structure of the aircraft. This was a major breakthrough. We’re doing the same for cars."

So we saved more mass than the rest of the vehicle than the non cell portion of the battery. So it’s like, “How do you really minimize the mass of a battery? Make it negative. Make the non cell portion of battery pack negative.” So it also allows us to pack the cells more densely because we do not have intermediate structure in the battery pack. So instead of having these supports and stabilizers and stringers and structural elements in the battery, we now have a lot more space in the battery because the pack itself is structural."

So it effectively glues the cells to the top and bottom sheet. And this allows you to do shear transfer between upper and lower sheet. Just like if you have a formula one craft or a racing boat, and you have carbon fiber face sheets and aluminum honeycomb between them, this gives you incredible stiffness and it’s really the way that any super fast thing works is you create basically a honeycomb sandwich with two face sheets."

Because aircraft do not do this. They can’t do this because fuel is liquid. So in our case the batteries are solid. So we can actually use the steel shell case of the battery to transfer shear from the upper and lower face sheet, which makes for an incredibly stiff structure, even stiffer than a regular car. In fact, if this was a convertible that had no upper structure, that convertible will be stiffer than a regular car. So it’s just really major."

And then those castings are also quite important because you want to transfer load into the structural battery pack in a very smooth, continuous way. So you don’t put arbitrary point loads into the battery. So you want to sort of feather the load out from the front and rear into the structural battery. It also allows us to move the cells closer to the center of the car, because we don’t have the… In the top one we’ve got all the supports and stuff, so the volumetric efficiency of the structural pack is as much better than a non-structural pack. And we’re going to actually bring the cells closer to the center and because they’re closer to the center it reduces the probability of a side impact potentially contacting the cells because in any kind of side impact has to go further in order to reach the cells."

Which is if you think of when there’s a ice skater arms out or arms in. Arms in, you rotate faster. So if you can bring things closer to the center, you reduce the polar moment of inertia and that means the car maneuvers better. It just feels better. You won’t know why, but it just feels more agile. So it’s really cool. This is really major."

I really think that long-term in any cars that do not take this architecture will not be competitive,"
"And it’s not just at the product level, a better product. But in the factory, it’s a massive simplification. You saw the part removal, it’s casting machines, it’s the structural battery pack. So we’re looking at over 50% reduction in investment per gigawatt hour, 35% reduction in floor space. And we’ll continue to improve that as we make the vehicle factory of the future.",Yeah. So major improvements on all fronts from the cell all the way to the vehicle.
"All right. So stacking it up. We’re not just talking about cost or range. We’ve got to look at all the facets. So range increase, we’re unlocking up to 54% increase in range for our vehicles and energy density for our energy products. 56% reduction in dollars per kilowatt hour at the battery pack level, and a 69% reduction in investment per gigawatt hour, which is the true enabler when we talk back about how do we achieve this scale problem here.","Yeah. So I think it’s pretty nice that investment per gigawatt hour reduction is 69%. I mean, who would have thought?"
"Yeah, just happened to come out that way.","I mean, 0.420%, of course. So what this enables us to do is achieve a new trajectory in the reduction of cell cost. And now to be clear, it will take us probably a year to 18 months to start realizing these advantages and to fully realize the advantages probably it’s about three years or thereabouts. So if we could do this instantly we would, but it just really bodes well for the future and means that the long-term scaling of Tesla and the sustainable energy products that we make will be massively increased. So, what tends to happen as companies get bigger is things tend to slow down, actually they’re going to speed up."
And they have to speed up if we’re going to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.,"Yeah. Long-term we want to try to replace at least 1% of the total vehicle fleet on Earth, which is about 2 billion vehicles. So long-term, we want to try and make about 20 million vehicles a year."
"But I think it’s important to point out that when we talked about three terawatt hours by 2030, the problem is a 20 terawatt hour problem. So everybody needs to be accelerating their efforts to accomplish these objectives. It doesn’t matter where you are in the value chain. There is a ton to do, you need to rethink from first principles how you do it, so that you can scale to meet all of our objectives.",Yep.
"And, Elon.",Sure.
What does this mean…,"What does this mean for our future products? So we’re confident that long-term we can design and manufacturer a compelling $25,000 electric vehicle. This has always been our dream from the beginning of the company. I even wrote a blog piece about it because our first car was an expensive sports car, then it was a slightly less expensive sedan, and then finally sort of a, I don’t know, mass market premium, the Model 3 and Model Y. But it was always our goal to try to make an affordable electric car. And I think probably, like I said, about three years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous."
"And when you think about the $25,000 price point, you have to consider how much less expensive it is to own an electric vehicle. So actually it becomes even more affordable at that $25,000 price point.","Yeah. So we have and extreme performance and range. And we should probably talk about, more or less, Plaid. What about that? So, yeah. Anyway, we took the latest Plaid out to Laguna Seco on Sunday, it got a minute 30, and we think probably there’s another three seconds or more to take off that time. So we’re confident the Model Plaid will achieve the best track time of any production vehicle ever, of any kind, two-door or otherwise."

And it’s available basically in the next year. And now we’ll move to Q&A.
Absolutely.,So we’ll invite a few people on stage.
Come on up team.,"This is just a small portion of the team, but I thought it’d be great to show you some more of the team and when we do Q&A we can give various people different questions to answer."
"Sounds great. Actually, I don’t know how we’re getting the questions.","Actually, I don’t know either. You can maybe get out of the car for two seconds and yell it at us. How are we getting the questions?"
"Oh, there are mics. Wait for the mic.","Oh, there are mics. Okay, great, great."
All right.,"Okay. We’ll definitely needs to give people mics cause otherwise there’s no way. Sorry? All right. We’re going to pass some mics out. Oh, we don’t have a name for the $25,000 car yet."
"Elon, you talked about in Berlin that you were going to [inaudible 02:40:45] manufacturing [inaudible 02:40:44].","Yes, we will be manufacturing cells in Berlin. Yep."
For homes.,"Oh, you mean like the home HVA? Yeah. That’s a pet project that I’d love to get going on. I don’t know, maybe we’ll start working on that next year. Because I just think, man, you could really make a way better home HVAC system that’s really quiet and super efficient, super energy efficient, and also has a way better filter for particles. And it works very reliably, and we’ve already developed that for the car. So the heat pump in the Model Y is really pretty spectacular. It’s tiny, it’s efficient, it has to last for 15 years, it’s got to work in all kinds of conditions from the coldest winter to the hottest summer. So we’ve actually already done a massive amount of the work necessary for a really kick-ass home HVAC."

So if you want to say, depending upon the size of your house or whatever, how much you need, you can just basically stack them and just have a very compelling, super efficient home HVAC. And then you could also communicate with the car and it’ll know when you’re coming home. So it’s like, “Oh, I don’t need to keep the house cold all day, I’ll just cool it down because I knew you were coming home.” So the pack can communicate with the car and just really dial it into when you actually need cooling and heating. It’ll be great."
"Hello? Hey guys, Eli here from Tesla Owners Club, my Tesla adventure. Just quick question, so I’m a huge fan of car camping in my Tesla with my dream case, my all time favorite activity, is it going to be possible to get climate control to the back of the cyber truck? Because that would be the ultimate camping machine if we can get all night climate control.","We’ll try to do that. Yeah. I agree, that would be really cool. Yeah."
"Hello, longtime fan, Elon, great guy. Just a question, how does the ICE industry look like in the future?","Well, I don’t think there will be at ICE industry longterm. Well, I guess there might be like a few things that it’s a like curious thing. There’s still like some steam engines made somewhere, but they’re just basically sort of quirky collector’s items. I mean, that will be the future of the internal combustion engine car."
"Hi, Elon, to your left here in the white Model y. Ryan McCaffrey from the Ride the Lightning Tesla podcast. Curious about cyber truck, it was interesting to see where you had it in on the battery technology front. I’m sort of curious what you see for it in the production front. Trucks are so popular in America, do you see its volume equaling the 3 or the Y in the future? And also, were Tesla’s able to legally be sold in Texas as part of the Giga Texas deal?","Well, it’s hard to say what the volume exactly would be for the cyber truck. The orders are gigantic. We have like, I don’t know, well over half a million orders, I think maybe six or 600,000. It’s a lot, basically, we stopped counting. So I think there’s probably room for, I don’t know, at least like a unit volume of like 250 to 300,000 a year, maybe more. Now, we are designing the cyber truck to meet the American spec. Because if you try to design a car to meet the super set of all global requirements you can’t make the cyber truck, it’s impossible. So it really is designed for the American market, but this is the biggest market. Our North American market is the biggest market for pickup trucks by far or large pickup trucks."

So it really is designed for the American market, but this is the biggest market. Our North American market is the biggest market for pickup trucks by far or large pickup trucks.","And then I think we’ll probably make an international version of cyber truck that’ll be kind of smaller, kind of like a tight Wolverine package. It’ll still be cooler, but it’ll be smaller because you just can’t make a giant truck like that for most markets. So, yeah, but it’s going to be great."

It’ll still be cooler, but it’ll be smaller because you just can’t make a giant truck like that for most markets. So, yeah, but it’s going to be great.","And I don’t know. I think probably we’ll be able to sell directly in Texas. We do pretty well right now, but it is a bit weird not being able to actually conclude a transaction in Texas, but it’s got to be like a click on a server based in California. But weirdly we can do leasing in Texas, but not selling. Hopefully that’ll get cleared up in the future."
"Elon, great job with everything that you’re doing. It’s Ross Gerber from Gerber Kawasaki. Your team’s amazing. What I’m most curious about, these innovations are incredible but on my drive up here fully on autopilot for 400 miles, the entire state is brown and this is ultimately about climate. Has there been some analysis done if all these things are achieved, what will its direct impact be on climate?","I think it will have a very significant impact because it will stop the CO2 PPM from growing as it is every year. I should say, I try to view the whole climate thing as a science question as much as possible. Science, you always question your hypothesis, is it true? Is not true? Or assign a probability to a given hypothesis. And I should say that my original interest in electric vehicles predates the climate issue. When I was in high school, I thought, “Man, if we don’t figure out electric cars, the whole economy’s going to collapse when we run out of oil.” So we better figure out electric cars and sustainable energy or civilization’s going to crumble."

When I was in high school, I thought, “Man, if we don’t figure out electric cars, the whole economy’s going to collapse when we run out of oil.” So we better figure out electric cars and sustainable energy or civilization’s going to crumble.","And then it was only later that the significance of the climate risk became apparent. And we were also able, using tracking and other types of technology to access a lot more fossil fuels than previously thought, which is helpful for lowering the cost of gasoline, but it’s pretty bad for the total tonnage of CO2 that you could put in the atmosphere. It’s now greatly beyond what people previously thought. As we were just going through this presentation, it is a absolutely monumental task to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. The entire global economy is still more than 99% dependent on, or call it roughly 99% dependent on, fossil fuels. So although electric cars get a lot of press right now, as a percentage of the total global fleet it’s practically nothing. I would say yes, less than 1% of the global fleet is electric right now. Because of two billion cars and trucks and whatnot in use. So there’s a massive amount of work ahead. Just insane, like hard to comprehend how much work is ahead to get the new vehicle production to be sustainable, to massively increase the amount of stationary storage, which is critical because renewable energy is intermittent, wind, and solar is intermittent, sometimes the wind doesn’t blow and this obviously sun doesn’t shine at night, so you got to have batteries, a massive, massive number of batteries."
"Yeah, it’s hard to measure in direct impact, but it’s an experiment that we shouldn’t be performing. And the sooner we can end the experiment the sooner we can kind of move on in a fully sustainable way that is actually lower cost. I think the thing that people haven’t fully internalized is once we do get to the 25K car, the ownership cost of that car is incredibly lower than the prior car. And then on the solar side and wind, with the cost of solar wind coming down and with batteries coming down with them, the actual cost of energy on the grid is going down. So we’re sort of moving towards a sustainable lower cost future. So there’s not like a sacrifice.","That’s true. It is a false dichotomy to say that it’s either prosperity or sustainability. This is often used by oil and gas to say like, “Oh, well, do you want people to lose their jobs? Do you want to lower people’s standards of living? Do you want to make all these economic sacrifices really in order to have sustainability?” And the reality, as Drew was saying, is that sustainable energy is going to be lower cost, not higher cost than fossil fuels."
"And the one company to go work for, that’s going to have the biggest structural impact over the next 10 years at scale, it’s probably Tesla. So kudos to everyone at Tesla for what they’ve done to this point and going forward. The two questions for you, as you’ve looked at the auto in the storage markets, I know you’ve talked about it at kind of 50/50 longterm, but it seems like a lot of the battery cost curve achievements that you presented today, really make some of these storage opportunities much more feasible over the next five years. And so I guess the first part of the question is, does your calculus upon learning and improving these things, change on that 50/50 mix, or is there a role where storage becomes bigger? And then the second part of the question, with all these huge grand visions, who’s going to be with Tesla from a corporate perspective, accomplishing these things? Obviously, Tesla can’t do it alone, but when you look at some of the traditional auto industry or power, et cetera, I don’t see a lot of other Tesla’s.","Well actually, there’s a lot of companies in China that I think are doing great work with electric vehicles and also with stationary storage, although we don’t see that much in the US yet, but I think probably we will in the future. I don’t know, obviously we’re doing everything we can to encourage other companies to move to sustainable transport and also make stationary storage batteries. We made our patents freely available, we really try to tell these companies, “Hey, you really need to do this, or you won’t exist in the future,” but they don’t believe it. So we’ve talked until we’re blue in the face. What are we supposed to do? But we really are hopeful that other companies will also do what we’re doing and that will make a sustainable future come sooner."
"Thinking long-term, is there any other segments that this new battery will be able to disrupt or electrify, beyond just the initial Model 2 or cheaper sedan? Like a Boring Company loop, plane-",Where are you? Are you there?
What’s up? Right here.,"Okay, great. It’s like ventriloquism here, we just get the sound out of the speaker and can’t tell where the heck it’s coming from."
"Yeah. Any hints or is the model too such a big deal because it decreases the cost of transportation, that that is really the disruption, or should we get hyped that this new cost curve opens up different vehicle categories, like a high passenger density bus, Boring loop, boat, plane?","Well, I mean, there are batteries in limited production right now, that do exceed 400 watt hours per kilogram, which I think is about the number you need for a decent range, medium range aircraft. And I think our batteries will, over time, start to approach the 400 watt hours per kilogram range as well. So yeah, I mean, I think over time, we’ll see all modes of transport, with the ironic exception of rockets, transition to sustainability or to electric basically. On the rocket front, what we’re planning to do is, about 80% of Starship is liquid oxygen and we’re actually already running a power line to be able to use wind power to create the liquid oxygen. So we’re making some decent progress on sustainability on the rocket front, but there’s just no way to have an electric rocket. And it’s important for the future of life and consciousness, that we become a multi planet species, so got to keep doing that."
"Hi Elon, Josh Phillips here, retail investor. I have a question in regards to the lithium and nickel industries and the likely price spikes and shortages of high grade materials the EV industry is likely to see if they don’t act fast to address future supply. Tesla have clearly made the right moves that are necessary, but there’s a real worry that the potential supply issues and price spikes will create a drag on the rest of the EV industry and therefore a drag on global EV adoption. What advice would you give to the EV and mining industries to quickly solve this looming hurdle? Because for a sustainable energy future, the spice must flow. Thank you.","Yeah, indeed. The spice must flow. The new spice. I don’t know. I’m not sure. I guess we can try to basically overdo it in cell production and perhaps supply cells to others, but we do see the fundamental constraint, as total cell production. That’s why we’re putting so much effort into making cells and kind of trying to reinvent every aspect of cell production, from mining the ore, to a complete battery pack, because it’s the fundamental constraint. We’re not getting into the cell business just for the hell of it, it’s because it’s the fundamental constraint, it’s the thing that is the limiting factor for rapid growth. But we could certainly try to overdo it on cell production and perhaps sell cells to others, although we are going at absolute top speed, so it’s not like we’re holding it back."

So the iron phosphate’s a lower energy density solution, but while there are some limitations on the total amount of nickel produced every year, there’s really no limit on the iron. There’s so much iron it’s ridiculous. So you can really scale up iron phosphate at a raw materials basis, more than you can nickel."
"Yeah. Diversification on the cathode side, is obviously massive and EVs are all about efficiency. And so for the EV industry, for the vehicle industry, we need to see powertrain efficiency really increase, all other companies, matching Tesla powertrain efficiency, so that everyone can have that diversified cathode approach, where LFP is used in medium range, and even really make a 300 mile vehicle with LFP. And really the goal that we were trying to present here, was a model for vertical integration, strategic vertical integration, that a lot of different people can do. What we need to see is vertical integration that shortens the process path, from mine to cathode. And what we’re doing here is novel and we’re trying to push the industry in that direction. So we’re presenting a model here that anyone can can follow.","Yeah. In fact, if there’s anything that you guys want to comment on, feel free to step forward and say something."
"I think the key is to be smart about your chemistry choices, your materials choices.",Talk louder.
"Hello, Elon. This is Ben Limpic, I’m a musician. I was wondering, does Tesla have any future plans to make partnerships with music companies, like it has done with Tencent games or things like that, for you guys to actually kind of expand your services for artists and other types of creative people, to get involved in producing content that can be part of the Tesla ecosystem or so other people that do creative things can get involved with you guys?","We haven’t really thought about it that much, but I suppose it’s probably something we should think about. We will be providing a title on the Tesla’s. So we’re providing more music sources that people can choose from and just generally trying to improve the entertainment experience in the cars. And I think actually as we go to a more autonomous future, the importance of entertainment and productivity will become greater and greater. I mean, to the degree that if you’re just basically sitting in your car, the car is fully autonomous and driving somewhere, the car is essentially your chauffeur and then the things that become important are, okay, well let’s have good entertainment and if you want to do some productivity stuff, then that actually starts to become much more important because you’re no longer spending your attention driving the car. So it will be extremely important in the future."
Okay. Should we do the second one?,"Yeah. The first one, I think we already answered. If we’re able to make enough cells, which we’ll try to do, we will supply other companies. It’s definitely not an intentional effort to keep the cells to ourselves, if we can make enough for other companies, we will supply them. And we were trying to do the right thing for advancing the sustainable energy, whatever that is."
"Yeah. The first one, I think we already answered. If we’re able to make enough cells, which we’ll try to do, we will supply other companies. It’s definitely not an intentional effort to keep the cells to ourselves, if we can make enough for other companies, we will supply them. And we were trying to do the right thing for advancing the sustainable energy, whatever that is.","Vehicle to grid, we get asked that a lot. I think one of the things that’s important to note, is vehicle to grid, unless you have a power cutoff, you need to cut off your main supply to the grid, otherwise, if you lose the power in your house, you’ll basically just backflow energy to the grid. So just having a reversal in the power flow, does not actually keep the lights on, you need a whole separate system to cut off power to the grid. And I think there’s also the case that people really want the freedom to be able to drive and to charge at their house. And it’s obviously very problematic if you get to morning and your car, instead of being charged, it discharged into the house and then you’re sort of, “Okay, now I can either drive or use the battery to power my house.”"

And it’s obviously very problematic if you get to morning and your car, instead of being charged, it discharged into the house and then you’re sort of, “Okay, now I can either drive or use the battery to power my house.”","I think it’s actually going to be better for people’s freedom of action, to have a power wall and a car separate, and then everything works that. You basically combine that with solar, either solar retrofit or solar glass roof, and local battery storage, so you basically become your own utility and then the car can be charged also with solar. I think that’s the stuff that works, that said, we can certainly do vehicle to grid, I think we can basically enable that with software in Europe or something, right?"
"Yeah. Future generations of power electronics, we will be able to do this more or less everywhere, from a energy market participation perspective, but from a backing up the house and it just so happens that the way the North American connectors are, on all the cars in North America, it doesn’t matter whether it’s the Tesla connector or the connector that the other vehicles have, doesn’t actually support powering your home. It’s unfortunate, so you’d need an additional hardware to do that. But yeah, in the future, all versions of our vehicles will be able to at least do bi-directional power flow for the purposes of energy market participation. But even for that, it’s important to remember that your car is in plugged in 24/7, so it’s kind of an unpredictable resource for the grid. It’ll have a value, but it’s not the same as a stationary battery pack.","Yeah. Honestly, a vehicle to grid sounds good, but I think actually has a much lower utility than people think. I think very few people would actually use vehicle to grid. With the original roadster, we had vehicle to grid capabilities, nobody used it."
How do we find the engineers to do everything we’re saying?,"How do we find the engineers to do all these things? Well, I guess we recruit a lot of engineers from all parts of the world. I think Tesla has a good reputation for doing exciting engineering and that tends to attract a lot of the top engineers in the world because they know that their efforts at Tesla will really serve the greater good and we’re super hardcore about engineering. Tesla is first and foremost an engineering company, it’s like hardcore engineering is what we do. The sheer amount of hardcore engineering done at Tesla is insane. And if you look at say, there’s various surveys done of engineering schools, where do you want to go, what’s your top choices? And actually the top two choices last few years, have been Tesla and SpaceX. So sometimes it’s Tesla first and sometimes SpaceX first, but those are the two top ones."
"Yeah. I mean, if you’re motivated to solve some of these problems, which are the hardest problems in the world to solve, that really fundamentally enable the future we all need, please reach out and help us work on these problems.","Absolutely. And like you said, the battle is far from over. Less than 1% of the global automotive fleet has been converted to electric and even maybe less than 0.1% of stationary storage has been done. So stationary storage has barely begun, converting the global vehicle fleet to electric, has barely begun. So there’s still a massive amount of engineering work to be done at Tesla and other companies, to accelerate this transition to sustainability."
"This is Jordan from Mark Asset Management. So you’ve talked about the importance of the factory and you’ve mentioned the ground up design process and a lot of the new things that you’re going to be doing or started to do in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin. Can you just maybe help us understand and quantify, how financially meaningful all of those improvements will be, and then given what you’re trying to accomplish as a company, is it fair to assume that the vast majority of improvement will be given back to the customer in the form of lower prices?","Yeah. I mean, I think certainly we will try to give back as much as possible to the customers. It’s not like Tesla’s profitability is crazy high, our average profitability for last four quarters, is maybe 1%. So just to be clear, it’s not like we’re minting money. Our evaluation makes it seem like we are, but we’re not. So we do want to try to make the price as competitive as we can, without losing money. If you keep losing money, you’ll just die. So this thing called profit is just like, we need to bring in more money than we spend, otherwise we’re dead."
"But affordability is key to how we scale, right? The demand goes non-linear as you reduce the price of the car.","Yeah. I mean, it’s important to sort of separate the difference between affordability and value for money or desirability of the product. So for a lot of people, they want to buy a Tesla, they simply don’t have enough money. We could make the car infinitely desirable, but if somebody does not have enough money, they can’t buy it. Sometimes people kind of forget this. People have to have enough money to buy the car and just making a car super desirable, but expensive, does not mean they can afford it. So it’s absolutely critical that we make cars that people can actually afford. Go through some of these things, scroll down or something."
"When do you expect Tesla vehicles to beat ICE vehicles on initial purchase price? I think a way to answer that question, is in the classes of vehicles we sell today, we’re already doing that.","Yeah. We’re already pretty close. And then factoring in total cost of ownership and the fact that electric vehicles require much less servicing and are way cheaper to run, when you look at total cost of ownership. And you can always lease a car, so if you just lease a car or get a loan for a car, you’ve got your sort of monthly payments and then your cost for either gasoline or electricity and your cost of servicing and the fully considered cost of electric car is much less than a gasoline car of the same nominal purchase price. I mean, that said, maybe on the order of three years, when we can do lower cost, like a $25,000 car, I think that will be basically on par, maybe slightly better than a comparable gasoline car. So I think maybe it’s on the order of three years-ish."
"How have the technology advancements and increased vertical integration of battery manufacturing, influenced your ability to improve the environmental and social impact of the supply chain? And I think … Yeah.",We sort of have said that already.
Yeah.,Do we have some ability to scroll through this? Just scroll away.
We covered recycling.,Yeah. Just scroll until we’ve got stuff that we haven’t covered.
We definitely covered that top one.,"Yeah, a lot of the things we’ve already asked really."
Covered that. That one.,We literally just answered that.
"Yeah. Oh, I saw a cathode durability question. Let’s go to that one, go down, go down, go down. Good technical question. Keep going. How are you going to address the cathode durability and cost and environmental impact trifecta? Is this something you’re going to leave the environment upstream and supply chain to solve? No, I think we tried to answer that directly. I mean, we really are looking at not just what happens in the cathode facility, but currently outside the cathode facility that should really be inside and removing processes that shouldn’t have been there in the first place and the use of reagents that are just costly and not necessary and removing a bunch of wastewater from the process.","Guys, is there anything you want to add to … Maybe we can go through everyone and maybe say what you’re doing and say a few words. I don’t know."
Sure. I just want to reiterate the fact that this is a massive problem.,Massive problem.
"And it seems like Tesla’s on its way and ahead, but we need everybody’s help because it’s everybody’s planet and we’re not going to get to 20 terawatt hours by ourselves. So please think about this carefully, as it affects everybody, so let’s get on it.","Yeah. And obviously, if you care about solving sustainability and doing hardcore engineering, definitely come work for Tesla."
"I’m Scott, I focus on cell design. I think it’s hard to put into words how inspiring this is, been at it such a long time with Tesla. And I really hope others do join us-",Since when Scott?
"Any existing specification is wrong, any existing manufacturing method is wrong, process equipment, it’s wrong, it’s just a question of how wrong. Quote Elon Musk.","Exactly. We’re wrong, just the question of how wrong. Trying to be less wrong."
"So tell us how we’re wrong and how we can do it better, so that we can accelerate and improve as fast as possible.","All right. Well, I guess thank you everyone for coming. I hope you liked the presentation. Very exciting future ahead. We’re going to work our damnedest to transition the world to sustainable energy as quickly as possible, and your support and help is key to that success. So thanks again, super appreciated and look forward to the next event. Thank you."
Elon?,"Thank you. First of all, I’d like to thank the Tesla team for exceptional execution in the second quarter. Despite tremendous difficulties, they’ve done an incredible job and it’s an honor to work with such a great team. I mean, there were so many challenges, too numerous to name, but they got it done. And it just what a great group to work with. Like I said, it’s just an honor to work such a great team. So as a result, we were able to achieve a fourth consecutive profitable quarter. And although the automotive industry was down about 30% year over year in the first half of the year, we managed to grow deliveries in the first half of the year. So despite that massive industry decline, we actually went up."

It’s going to be a right near Austin. It’ll be about … I’ll go into better detail on this and I’m sure there will be a lot of questions. But the location is five minutes from Austin International Airport and 15 minutes from downtown Austin. It’s about 2000 acres and we’re going to make it a factory that it’s going to be stunning.

And it’s also where we’ll be doing cyber truck there, the Tesla semi, and we’ll be doing Model 3 and Y for the Eastern half of North America.","Now at the same time, I want to say we will continue to grow in California, but we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the Western half of North America. And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also makes sense in California. So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California and just emphasize we’ll continue to grow in California, but we’ll be creating a massive factory and cyber truck and semi programs in Texas. And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, economic development team and the Governor, really I was super impressed. The Tesla team was super impressed, and we will for sure strongly consider Tulsa for a future expansion of Tesla down the road. Let’s see. Is there anything more you want to say about? This is a lot of information, so. Anything else, guys? All right. Well, I’m sure there will be lots of questions. We’ve already started work on the facility so some initial construction work it’s already underway out of this weekend."

Solar, we recently adjusted the pricing about retrofit solar. So Tesla solar is the lowest cost solar in the United States. And we added a lowest cost guarantee and a money back guarantee. So we’re very confident that people will love our solar product, whether it’s this whole retrofit or solar roof. Our solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average. After the federal tax credit, Tesla Solar now costs $1.49 per watt, and it’s a very simple, highly automated single click experience. So definitely think about a Tesla, whether you want a new roof, Tesla solar roof, or you want solar on your existing roof. Either way, we’re the company to go to."

So I think that product is really coming together and it’s only going to get better later this year. So just very excited about that business potential. On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car with more than 400 miles range. So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA certified range of 402 miles. I mean, basically you can drive from LA to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over when you arrived and this was at highway speeds. So you don’t have to do anything, drive slowly or anything. You just drive it. You can just drive normally and go very long distances."

And we’re currently testing also driving software for intersections and city streets and narrow streets. So I personally test the latest [inaudible 00:05:54] of full self driving software when I drive my car. And it is really, I think, profoundly better than people realize. Yeah, really profoundly better. It’s amazing. So it’s almost getting to the point where I can go from my house to work with no interventions, despite going through construction and widely varying situations. So this is why I am very confident about full self driving, the functionality being complete by the end of this year, because I’m literally driving it."

It was incredibly difficult and just as a result of the hard work of a lot of people from Tesla worldwide. And yeah, just think about the next 12 to 18 months, we’ll have three new factories in place. Things are looking great with a Giga Berlin and we’ll have cyber truck, semi, Roadster, full self driving. There’s so much to be excited about. It’s really hard to kind of put into this call, but the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the autonomy and the manufacturing engineering front is mindblowing."

And I think that’s really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see. So with that, thanks again for your support in our long term mission. And we’re looking forward to having a great journey with you to create amazing products and continue scaling it. And yeah, I think I’ve never been more optimistic or excited about the future of Tesla and then the history of the company. Thank you."
"Thank you very much. Let’s go to questions from institutional investors first. The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the longterm goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years beyond Model 3, Y and the cyber truck? Cheaper, smaller versions of 3 and Y or region specific vehicles or anything else?","Well, I don’t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what’s announced because I think we want to reserve that for product launches. It would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher capacity passenger vehicle of some kind. These are likely things at some point, but I do think there’s a long way to go with 3 and Y and with cyber truck and semi. It’s a long way to go with those. I think we’ll do the obvious things."
"Okay. The second question from institutional is, what is your vision for self-drive Tesla? What opportunities do you see for monetizing the installed base other than by FST?","Right now I thought FST as just overwhelmingly the most important thing. I think the upgrading of the fleet to full self driving, especially with an over the air software update, may go down as the biggest asset value increase in history as a step change. Maybe there’s something bigger, but it certainly would be one of the biggest. I can’t think of anything bigger. So overnight, a million depending exactly when it happens and when it’s allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions."

So overnight, a million depending exactly when it happens and when it’s allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions.","… regulatory jurisdictions you’d have like, I don’t know, at least a few million cars suddenly becoming five times more valuable or something like that. So like five times higher utility to go from like 12 hours a week of utility, something like that. That’s how many hours they used, 260, something like that. Everything else is pretty small by comparison. Now, when things do become full self-driving, so what are people going to do in the car? Well, I guess they’re probably going to do productivity and entertainment of some kind, watch movies, play games, and do work. That’s in the future. We’re already putting some games and stuff on the car just for fun."
"Yeah. We have been experimenting on that. FSD remains by far and away the biggest opportunity in the near term, but we’re putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale other areas when the time is right. So premium connectivity subscription is something that we put in place and the ability to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on acceleration boost or upgrading a standard range Model 3 to a Standard Plus, adding rear heated seats. These are things that we have, and we’re continuing to get feedback from the field on other things that we can launch, and we’ll trickle those in with time.",Yeah. But they’re all very tiny compared with… The step change to full self driving depending upon high calculated is probably worth at least a hundred thousand dollars per car. That’s a lot of software you have to sell in the app store or whatever.
"Thank you. The third question is also about autopilot. What are the most important upcoming self-driving milestones, and how do you think about timing?","Well, the actual major milestone that’s happening right now is really transition of the autonomy system of the cars like AI, if you will, from thinking about things in like two and a half D. It’s basically taking isolated pictures and doing image recognition on pictures that are partially correlated in time but not very well. And transitioning to kind of a 4D, which is video essentially. You’re thinking about the world in three dimensions and the fourth dimension being time. So that architectural change, which has been underway for some time but has not really been rolled out to anyone in the production fleet is what really matters for full self driving."

So it’s just hard to convey just how much better a fully 4D system does work. It’s capable of things that if you’re just looking at things as individual pictures as opposed to video, basically you go from like individual pictures to a surround video. This is fundamental. The car will seem to have just like a giant improvement. We’ll probably roll it out later this year, but be able to do your traffic lights, stop, turns, everything pretty much."

How many nines of reliability are okay? So it’s definitely way better than human, but how much better than human does it need to be? That’s actually going to be the real work. There’s just a massive amount of work with each kind of order of magnitude of reliability. You’ll see a [inaudible 00:20:12] happen and if you plot the points on a curve, it’ll be kind of obvious where it’s headed. AI in general, I think is something… I’ve been banging this AI drum for a decade, we should be concerned about where AI is going. The people I see being the most wrong about AI are the ones who are very smart because they can’t imagine that a computer could be way smarter than them. That’s the flow in their logic. They’re just way dumber than they think they are."
"Thank you. The next question from this additional investor is, please may you update us on alien dreadnought? How has your thinking evolved, and what is needed in order to get closer to fundamental physical limits?","A massive amount of effort into manufacturing engineering, the machine that makes the machine is probably a 1000%, maybe 10000% more engineering required for the factory than for the product itself. So we’re certainly making progress. I mean, battery and powertrain Gigafactory in Nevada is on an alien dreadnought version 0.5, something like that. Starting to approach version one. We’re getting way better at making cars. You can see that in Giga Shanghai. You’ll see that even more with Berlin and we’re really changing the design of the car in order to make it more manufacturable. The fundamental architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin. It may look the same, but the internals will be quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturally than what we’ve done to date. Drew, would you like to add to that?"
"Yeah, I was going to expand on that thought. I think part of the alien dreadnought concept is not just automation, but minimizing the number of process steps and complexity involved in the manufacturing system, which involves really integrating design and manufacturing across when the raw materials enter the factory to the finished goods exit. We’re learning so much through doing that.","Yeah. Vertical integration is extremely important for this. But the supply chain, if you put a GPS tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable product, it would look insane. It would be like, wow, it went around the world like six times. With vertical integration, maybe you can only go around the world once. It’s a huge improvement. I think if we could get vertical integration, we could probably get you an order magnitude improvement. Yeah. [inaudible 00:08:29]."
Yeah. I think the focus for us is increasing CapEx efficiency. This is something that we’ve been working very hard for the past three years. You can see that we can build new factories for less amount of money and much faster.,Yeah.
Those things work together.,It’s a better factory for less money and less time.
"Yeah, less money means less time. So that’s a great advantage. We’re also reducing, and this still is a lot, the amount of inefficiencies. We want every operation to add value to the vehicle, value meaning moving the atoms closer to the final state. So we do not want any robot that just moves things.","Yes. [crosstalk 00:09:21]. In fact, it’s like we want to be super respectful of people’s labor. If we’re asking somebody to do something, are we sure it’s useful? Are we asking them to spend their time in a way that is respectful of their time? But it’s like, wow, the potential for improvement is just tremendous. I just want to be clear, here at Tesla, we love manufacturing. It’s awesome. I really think more smart people should be working on manufacturing. It’s like-"
We want more people.,Yes. We love it. We do.
"If people are interested in designing new lines and trying to do things different, Tesla has got a job for you. Now we’ve got jobs everywhere. It’s not only in California. We got jobs in China, in Berlin, in Austin, Texas, and in California. So there’s plenty of exciting places and all these places will do original work and challenging and meaningful work.","Absolutely. It’s actually extremely exciting and fulfilling to design new production systems. I think that for some reason I kind of got a bad rap, especially in the US for a long time. I think people don’t think that manufacture… They thought of manufacturing as like, “Oh, it’s just some boring, just making copies or whatever.” But actually there’s far more opportunity for innovation in manufacturing than in the product itself. Order magnitude. If there’s one thing that comes out of this call, it’s like, “Hey, if you want to help us invent amazing manufacturing techniques and have them put into the product itself.” It’s not like you just get tossed the product and say, “Hey, make this product.” And it’s kind of a lousy design. If you’re a manufacturer, you get to change the product design and say, “Hey, this product you’re asking me to manufacturer is dumb.” They’re like, “Great, let’s fix it.”"

You get to change the product design. So it’s super exciting. And we evolved [Alliance 00:26:37] even after their book, this rapid evolution of the production system."
"And there’s nothing more rewarding than going from zero cars an hour to 5,000 cars a week or a thousand cars a day.","Yeah. So the long term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think will be manufacturing."
"Thank you very much. The last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?","Well, right now, zero. But longterm, a lot."
Our biggest property.,Yeah. It’s the biggest property. True.
"Okay. Now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com. The first one is, Tesla energy seems widely ignored by Wall Street despite Elon’s comments about growth rate exceeding automotive. Could Tesla share more detail on current their plan projects to help investors better understand the business outlook? How disruptive is this Autobidder technology?","Yeah, I can’t emphasize enough. I think long term, Tesla energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla automotive. I mean the energy business collectively is bigger than the automotive business. So you say like, how big is the energy sector? Bigger than automotive. In order to achieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think is going to be primarily solar and by wind and those are intermittent. So you need to have a lot of batteries to store the energy because the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine. There’s like three elements of the sustainable energy future, wind and solar, sustainable energy generation, battery storage, and electric transport. Those three things. The mission of Tesla is to accelerate sustainable energy. I can’t emphasize enough the… Yeah. Battery and solar will both be enormous and they kind of have to be in order for us to have a sustainable future. We’ve got a great product roadmap on that front as well. [inaudible 00:29:09] the Megapack is very well received. Yeah, if you want to talk about that."
"Yeah. I think the Megapack has represented itself and is an integrated rapidly deployable grid type storage battery of megawatt hour scale. We’re working with utilities large and small, not just utilities, but also just micro grid and project developers of all types and building our own projects where it makes sense. There’s a lot of demand for the product and we’re growing the production rates as fast as we can for that product. Then on Autobidder, Autobidder is basically autopilot for grid tied batteries. It’s an autonomous energy market participation system that does high frequency trading and ensures-",That’s a bad word.
… frequency trading-,That’s a bad word.
"Sorry, sorry.",High frequency trading should be called front running. We’re not doing that.
"We’re not doing anything like that. No, it’s ensuring that the battery is doing everything it can to manage the [crosstalk 00:30:12] of the renewables, and just grid intermittency of all kinds. I mean, people turn their lights on and off. Power plants turn on and off. Factories ramp up and down, and batteries are great to solve those problems.","Yeah, it’s just grid stabilization at the millisecond level."
Exactly.,"So it just ensures that things are super smooth. It’s like UPS, an uninterruptible power supply, of a normal size. But just ensures that the grid has smooth sailing, and the batteries, the computers won’t interact with each other, and make sure that they’re working together to make the grid as smooth. And this can be done with the Power Walls and the Megapacks and the Power Packs all working together, and interacting with third party systems as well."
"Yeah, centrally or distributed, it does both.",Yeah.
"Yeah, I mean, yeah.",It’s necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.
"Yeah, you can’t plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world. You need to optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale and that’s what we’re doing.","Yeah, the real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. That’s a real limit. So, that’s where… We can talk a little more about this on Battery Day, because this is the fundamental scaling constraint. And any part of that supply chain or processing at the cell level will be the limiting factor. So, whatever it may be, anywhere from mining to refining. There’s many steps, in refining, to cathode and anode formation, cell formation, whatever the trouble point is, that will set the growth rate."

And there’s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day."
"It didn’t make sense up to now to do it, but we’ll be ready, and that’s… Maybe a little biased, but I’m very excited about this. We have a lot of very unique technology that we’re always dreaming about that we will be putting in to that semi. It will be just awesome.","Yeah. And just, there’s two general classes of cell. There’s iron phosphate and then the nickel-based. The nickel-based cells have higher energy density, so longer range. Obviously those are needed for something like the semi, where every unit of mass that you add in battery pack you have to subtract in cargo."
"Yeah. And just, there’s two general classes of cell. There’s iron phosphate and then the nickel-based. The nickel-based cells have higher energy density, so longer range. Obviously those are needed for something like the semi, where every unit of mass that you add in battery pack you have to subtract in cargo.","So it’s very important to have mass-efficient and long range pack for batteries. However, what we’re seeing with our passenger vehicles is our power train efficiency, tire efficiency, drag coefficient… If all of the things, HVAC, going into a heat pump, [inaudible 00:34:55] our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 in China. And that’ll be in volume production later this year."

And that’ll be in volume production later this year.","So we think that getting a range that is in the high 200’s… Basically, but we think, probably get a range of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into a whole bunch of power train and other vehicle efficiencies. And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and other projects that require higher energy density. So, yeah, [inaudible 00:35:49] two supply chains that you can tap into, iron phosphate or nickel."

So it’s really about nickel."
"Thank you. And the next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce standard range version of Model Y. No longer offers a standard range S or X, and has announced ramping of the semi. Does this shift from smaller pack vehicle suggest that Tesla is not battery-constrained as in the past? What are the biggest constraints now?","Well, I’d just like to re-emphasize [inaudible 00:36:32], any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay? Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel, and don’t wait for nickel to go back to some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficient, as environmentally friendly nickel mining, at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way. So, hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel."

So I think people will really come to expect that, as some number close to 300 miles, as normal. That’s a standard expectation."

So I think people will really come to expect that, as some number close to 300 miles, as normal. That’s a standard expectation.","Because you do need to take into account, is it very hot outside? Or very cold? Or are you driving up a tall mountain with a full load? And it’s… People don’t want to get to a destination with like 10 miles range. They want some reasonable margin."

Call it 500 kilometers, basically. Roughly."
Thank you. The next question on insurance. What is the holdup on Tesla Insurance outside of California? Will you release numbers from that part of the business? Will Tesla Insurance be required to participate in the Tesla ride hailing network as a driver?,Sure.
"Currently, we have a product in California, as I’ve described before, it’s been quite well received. And I would largely describe it as a fairly standard insurance product with elements of it that are unique to our cars. So you can think of it as a Version 1 of Tesla Insurance.",Version 0.9 [inaudible 00:39:13] at least.
"And then that product, as we continue to collect more data, and we iterate on it, there will be Version 2, Version 3, et cetera, as we continue to refine that.","Yeah, I mean, at the heart of being competitive with insurance is, what is the accuracy of your information? Are you dealing with… Are you forced to assess people statistically, looking in the rear view mirror? Or can you assess people individually, looking ahead with smart projections? And inform the driver of how they may reduce their… what actions they can take to reduce their insurance, as Zack was alluding to. It’s like, okay, you’re driving too fast. You’re doing this or that or the other thing. It’s like, if you want to pay more for insurance you can, but if you want to pay less, then please don’t drive so crazy."

Okay, they want to drive aggressively. In that case it will be higher insurance. They want to be more careful in their driving, it’ll be pay less. It’s just also actually very helpful for us to have a feedback loop to see what is driving insurance expense. A lot of it is just, you have like a little fender bender, and the next fender bender, because of the way that the body or collision repair is being done, costs $15,000 or something crazy. We can actually adjust the design of the car, and adjust how the repair is done, to actually have the fundamental cost of solving that problem be less."
"And people can make a choice. Okay, they want to drive aggressively. In that case it will be higher insurance. They want to be more careful in their driving, it’ll be pay less.

Without realizing it. This is a problem in general with insurance. It’s like, if insurance is like, all you can eat, then the feedback loop for improvement is weak."
"So this has helped us unearthed a bunch of silly things we were doing, basically. Without realizing it. This is a problem in general with insurance. It’s like, if insurance is like, all you can eat, then the feedback loop for improvement is weak.",So this gives us a great feedback loop for improvement. It gives us basically a fundamentally better insurance product.
So this gives us a great feedback loop for improvement. It gives us basically a fundamentally better insurance product.,"I’d also like to say, in the spirit of recruiting, if there’s one thing I’d like to come out of this call, it’s that a lot of great people want to join Tesla. That’s the number one thing I’d like out of this call. And on the insurance front, I want to be clear, we’re building a great, major insurance company. If you’re interested in revolutionary insurance, please join Tesla. I would love to have some high energy actuaries, especially. I have great respect for the actuarial profession. You guys are great at math. Please join Tesla. Especially if you want to change things, and you’re annoyed by how slow the industry is. This is the place to be. We want revolutionary actuaries."
"Thank you. And if I could just follow up Elan, you’ve talked a lot about the mission of the company and really trying to drive EV adoption globally. So how do you think about that trade off between driving towards industry leading profitability yet trying to make your cars more affordable and broader? It feels like historically you’ve always picked the path of, “I’d rather drive more growth and more adoption because ultimately that’s the mission of the company.” And we even saw it a little bit this quarter with price reductions. You could have probably kept price where it is sold some units and had better profits, but that’s been an ongoing choice that Tesla as a company has made. So how do you personally think about that trade off, even if you were to get to industry leading margins, wouldn’t you be inclined to give more of that back to drive a greater adoption more quickly?","Well, I think we actually achieve both when you factor in autonomy. I think we can go way beyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentially almost everyone when factoring in autonomy. But that was really a mega game-changer, [inaudible 00:52:42] changer."
"Well, I think we actually achieve both when you factor in autonomy. I think we can go way beyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentially almost everyone when factoring in autonomy. But that was really a mega game-changer, [inaudible 00:52:42] changer.","Yeah. It is important for people to distinguish between two things. There’s value for money that a product has, and then there’s affordability. And even if you rail value for money and have value for money, infinite. If people do not have enough money in the bank account to buy the car, they simply cannot. So then you just have this awesome thing and nobody can buy. so it is important to make the car affordable. We will not succeed in our mission if we do not make cars affordable."
"Yeah. It is important for people to distinguish between two things. There’s value for money that a product has, and then there’s affordability. And even if you rail value for money and have value for money, infinite. If people do not have enough money in the bank account to buy the car, they simply cannot. So then you just have this awesome thing and nobody can buy. so it is important to make the car affordable. We will not succeed in our mission if we do not make cars affordable.","The thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are not affordable enough. We need me to fix that. So we’re all making progress in that regard, just steadily making progress. So we need to not go bankrupt, obviously that’s important because that will fail in our mission. But we’re not trying to be super profitable either. Obviously profitability is like one or 2%. It’s not crazy. Last quarter was only 0.1%. So we want to be profitable. I think just, we want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible. That’s what we’re trying to achieve."
"Hi, good afternoon. Could you please characterize the current near term demand environment for your vehicles? These obviously unusual times, I think back in Q1 you had indicated direct [inaudible 00:54:43] backlog I guess at the beginning of this past quarter. I haven’t seen any specific comments about new orders as a backlog and then release today. So can you give us some color?","Demand is not our problem. Definitely not. We do have some production supply chain challenges we’re trying to solve right now. For example, the Model Y rear body casting, obviously, because it’s new technology, it’s been tricky to maintain rate and keep growing the rate for Model Y casting. Which it’s a two piece casting and there’s about half a dozen other parts that are added on that will transition to a one piece casting. If I can predict super excited about this. We’re going to have the world’s biggest casting press is getting assembled right now actually in Fremont for the Model Y rear body casting. It’s enormous and it looks awesome. So the things that are troubling us right now are not demand that they are just a bunch of fire fighting on supply chain and production issues."
Okay two part [crosstalk 00:56:03].,"Sorry. Yeah, don’t worry about demand. That’s not the issue."
"Okay. So when you’re saying achieving 500,000 deliveries has become more difficult was it’s really just a function of the recent shutdown and some of these supply dynamics?","Yeah. It’s not [inaudible 00:56:21] demand it’s really just a production issue. It’s pretty hard when you’ve got a global supply chain and it’s whatever the most effective part of that global supply chain is, that sets your rate. So the number of rabbits we’ve had to pull out of hat for supply chain is insane. Team’s done an amazing job. So I think it also some of our server costs were related to having to use a lot of airplanes to get parts around because of parts shortages. So hopefully get use for your airplanes, that will improve our costs. But it’s a dramatic feed supply right now. That’s where we are now."
"Good afternoon. And thank you. You mentioned a few times to us the constraint to growth fees is vary capacity still. And I was hoping you could clarify the scope of the Berlin plants we’re building right now. Will there be the battery capacity consistence with the amount of assembly volume you expect to come out of Berlin? And if not, will you be able to source your battery requirements out of Europe? Or would you have to import batteries from outside of Europe to ensure production and building?","Okay, well, we can’t say too much about this, except that there will be local cell production. And that will serve the needs of the Berlin factory. [inaudible 00:13:19]."
"No, that’s straightforward enough. I think just adding to what you said earlier about talent and people.",Yeah.
The same goes in all areas of cell.,Yes.
Thank you.,Those who know Europe will know what I’m talking about.
Okay. Thank you very much for everyone for joining this call and thank you for all your good questions. And we’ll speak to you again in about three months.,Yeah. Have you seen her with [inaudible 00:14:46].
"Thank you, Sharon, and good afternoon everyone, and welcome to the Tesla’s first quarter 2020 Q&A webcast. I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn, and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 1:00 PM Pacific time in the update that we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we’ll discuss our business outlook and make forward looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings for the SEC. During the question and answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Please press *1 now if you would like to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?","Thank you. So Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks. This is the first time we have achieved positive gap net income in a seasonally weak first quarter. Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, while wrapping two major products. What we’ve learned from this is that… We’ve actually learned a lot here. After the Model 3 ramp from three years ago, our new products get ramped faster and become profitable sooner. In Q1, we produced more model wise in the first quarter than Model 3 in Fremont in the first two quarters. Thus far, and Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1. More surprisingly, in other words, we’re ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already. Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven’t achieved with any product in the past."

Our cars will now automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to proceed. I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel that it is probably a safety improvement."

This number will grow exponentially as more people get the updates and as more people start driving again. Soon we will be collecting data from over a billion intersections per month. All of those confirmations are training annual net. Essentially, the driver when driving and taking action is effectively labeling reality as they drive and making the neural net better and better. I think this is an advantage that no one else has and we’re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined. I think this is difficult to fully appreciate. It’s the reason, I have to say, it’s very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because everyone is training Google all the time with their searches. So when you’re searching something and you click on a link, you’re training Google every time you do that. It’s just very difficult for any new search engine to compete on that basis."

We can almost do this already with the leading edge alpha builds that are driving the car."

It should be said that actually the real Model X range is 400 miles. But when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately the EPA left the car door open and the keys in the car, and they did this overnight. And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost 2% of its range, and as a result had a 391 on the test. As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we’ll redo the test and we’re actually in the confident that we will achieve a 400 mile or greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months, the true range of the Model S for the past two months has been 400 miles. And of course we’re not stopping there. We’ll always continue pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and all the little details that makes a Tesla special. For model Y, we introduced the revolutionary two piece rear underwater casting, that we’re going to making a single piece casting a later this year. Meaning essentially, the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, which no casting of the size of complexity has ever been done before. In fact, there isn’t even anything that is on par with the two piece casting for the Model Y. So we’re really pushing the envelope on the vehicle’s structural engineering and manufacturing. I’m very excited about this approach, as it allows us to reduce the weight, the cost and improve NVH. It’s better in every way, essentially."

So the Model Y has remarkable range on par with, in fact, probably slightly better than, I guess, the Model 3, despite being a bigger car that weighs more, and the heat pump is a key contributor to that. It is especially excellent at low temperature driving. And the feedback we’re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive. We’re confident that this product will be our best selling product ever."

We are absolutely continuing our model wide capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai, and here in Fremont when they will let us continue. Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, but you can count on our products will be even more competitive over time. While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite. We are absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company. And we’re really looking forward to being, in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and Europe at a capacity of well over a million units a year. So there’s a [inaudible 00:08:59] to look forward to, and we can’t wait to tell you what’s going to happen. Thank you."
"Thank you very much. So we’ll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by safe technologies. The first question from an institutional investor is, “Most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite most vehicles having old unnecessary hardware, what levers could you pull to accelerate the adoption and deepen your data advantage? For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?”","I think we will offer full stop driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year. I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option, as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the future and we are confident that is an investment that will pay off to the consumer, to the benefit of the consumer, and in my opinion, buying the FSD option is something people will not regret doing."
"… of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease will be the least expensive way on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value with time.",Yeah.
"We do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront, and so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription at the time.","Yeah, absolutely. I should mention at a high level our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness. That is our goal. We think that’s the kind of thing that all companies should try to do. It’s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty, the guest loyalty. Our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we’re confident that if we were to behave like that then customers, in turn, will behave the same way to us."
"Thank you. The second question for Institutional Investor is, China recently announced changes to its NEV Subsidy Program that disqualifies Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies. To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer so they can qualify for the subsidy?","Yeah. We are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China, and we’re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3 basically tomorrow China time, so the day after tomorrow California time, but tomorrow China time. That will be a price below the subsidy limit. We feel confident that that will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin."
"Thank you. The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crises. In which way has Tesla improved or is expected to improve coming out of Covid 19?","Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company. One always has to do that in a crisis. Just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do, and we came to conclusion that the right move is actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in the future and new technologies, even though it is risky. We’ve talked to some of our key investors and they support that approach as well. I think that there’s clearly an uncertain future ahead. It’s a bit of a bumpy road, but I think the longterm prospects are extremely good. Anything you guys want to add?"
"Yeah, I agree with that, Elon. The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think is great. The other one that I would add is it’s always been our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make that as digital as possible.",Yeah. Touchless delivery.
"Touchless delivery, mobile service, touchless sales, has been something that we’ve been very focused on and made a lot of progress on.",Yeah. The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone. You can order a car and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paperwork and everything done. That’s it. Effortless.
And many customers do that.,"And they’re doing it, yes. In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this is something you can do, because normally buying a car is quite a pain. For most people, they would rather go to the dentist than buy a new car. Actually my dentist is great, but it’s really like quite an arduous thing. When the typical retail experience with buying a new car is more painful to people than having a root canal, then you have to say, whoa. For Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something from the Apple app store or ordering something on Amazon, except it’s a car. Yeah. In five minutes. If you really went fast, I think you could order a car probably in 90 seconds."
"Thank you. The next question from Institutional Investor is, can you give us a brief preview of the Battery Day by generally highlighting steps Tesla is taking to improve cell energy density and timeline for introduction?","Yeah, actually. We don’t want to preempt Battery Day. We want to leave the exciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of exciting news to tell, and I think it would be one of the most exciting days in Tesla’s history. We’re just trying to figure out the right timing for that. We think probably the right timing will be probably the third week of May. I’m not giving a firm date, but we think that probably that’s the right timing, and depending upon what we’re allowed to do, it’ll either be in California or Texas."
"Just a couple of things on the financials for Full Self-Driving. Currently in North America it’s sold for $7,000 as an option. We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of it goes into deferred revenue. That’s associated with features that will be released with time. Our deferred revenue balance is continuing to grow. It’s a little bit over $600 million, and so as we release features with time, at the end of every quarter we take a look at what features have been released, associated value, and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our financials for that quarter. Then cars going forward, once a feature is released, we can recognize that revenue. We reduce the amount of deferral and we can recognize that revenue within period. This is what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.","Absolutely. There’s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential, with the fleet out there that could upgrade to turn on autopilot, basic autopilot or Full Self-Driving, and that’s something we will enable just as a support in-app purchase, or as we talked about earlier, towards the end of the year as a subscription. That’s just a lot of untapped potential there. That’s not in the deferred revenue line obviously, but is certainly a great deal of deferred potential that we think is a large portion which is likely to reach fruition."
"Thank you. Now let’s go to questions from retail investors. Question number one, Elon has mentioned a 50% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past. Is this still in line with Tesla’s ambitions for the next 5 to 10 years? This would 4 million vehicles in 2025 and more than 20 million vehicles in 2030. Is 40% a more realistic target?","Well, it’s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be. I think very few people would have predicted the unexpected sort of roundhouse that Covid came up with that sort of came out of nowhere. I think in the absence of some massive force majeure event, like quite massive, I think probably 50% is the likely number. It’s possible that it’s 40%. I would be very shocked if it’s less than 40%, even with a force majeure, short of World War Three."
"Okay. The next question from retail investors, when will you announce the next Giga? How many Gigas do you have planned for the next five years?","I think we’ll announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month. We may not as soon as next month. That’s not a prediction. It’s just saying that could happen. It will certainly be within three months, and possibly one month. That would be in the US. As for how many will be in five years, I don’t know right now what that number would be. I guess several more than there are today, but I’m not sure what exactly it would be in five years, but some number more than today."
I’ll also add that our Gigas have gotten bigger.,Yes. And arguably could be start being called Tera.
Thank you. The next question is can you give us an update on solar roof ramp? How many are you currently able to install per week? What is your installation’s per weeks targets for the end of 2021?,"We were actually gaining interest momentum with the solar roof before Covid, and Covid essentially shut us down, both from the ability to install and the ability to get permits. The permit offices were closed, and we were shelter-in-place, live-in-place. We obviously cannot install if you can’t get permits and you can’t physically do it, it’s physically impossible. But I think the longterm trend for solar roof is extremely good, and I’m confident that let’s say within the next, I don’t know, year or maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of a thousand a week."

Allowing for seasonality, it’s hard to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice, but in spring I think it’s installing, which is the hard part. We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit a thousand a week gross build rate for the solar glass roof already, so that’s not a problem. It’s building up the install teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry installers, and internally we want to have at least a thousand solar roof install teams, taking a week or perhaps a little less than a week to do an install, which gets you a thousand a week roof installations. We see demand is good, production is good, so it’s really all about the install. Then, like I said, also building up the training, the very diverse group of companies in the roofing industry, to also install solar roof, that I think will allow us to scale far beyond a thousand a week."

We’re confident that this will be a very significant product for the company over time."
"Thank you. The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla’s plan to enter the residential and/or commercial HVAC market? Can you provide some basics of how your system will work, whether you consider the heat-pump water heater market as well?","Well as I said on Twitter, I’m personally extremely excited to build a kick ass HVAC system that also has a sort of hospital grade particle filtration, basically HEPA filtration, that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi, and also neutralizes-"
"Well as I said on Twitter, I’m personally extremely excited to build a kick ass HVAC system that also has a sort of hospital grade particle filtration, basically HEPA filtration, that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi, and also neutralizes-","… and it also neutralizes acidic alkaline gases; that is quiet and efficient. And these are all things we’ve achieved in that car. By the way, in fact, I don’t know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S and X are the only cars in the world that have a hospital operating room-grade HEPA filters built in. They’re very big, but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars."
"And 3 and Y have like MERV 16 or 15 capable filtration also, which is-","Yeah. It’s not like Model 3 and Y… They’re no slouches. Model 3 and Y, they’re way better than any other car to the best of my knowledge. They’re not quite as good as hospital operating room, but they’re extremely good. Way better than any other normal car. And we’re continuing to improve the filters on 3 and Y. I believe these actually have a big effect on health, even in normal, just day-to-day living. It’s reducing particle count and it has an effect on allergies and all sorts of things. Air quality is incredibly important, even in a non-COVID situation, extremely important."
"Yeah. It’s not like Model 3 and Y… They’re no slouches. Model 3 and Y, they’re way better than any other car to the best of my knowledge. They’re not quite as good as hospital operating room, but they’re extremely good. Way better than any other normal car. And we’re continuing to improve the filters on 3 and Y. I believe these actually have a big effect on health, even in normal, just day-to-day living. It’s reducing particle count and it has an effect on allergies and all sorts of things. Air quality is incredibly important, even in a non-COVID situation, extremely important.","So taking all those things that we’ve learned and applying them to how a commercial HVAC would be just very exciting. And then if you’re condensing water, like one of our goals is to have it be a water source. If you have water, you possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well."
"Yeah, use it as a heat source if you need it instead of the outdoors when the outdoors is really cold.",Yeah.
Or the other way around. So lots of options.,"And it could be a hell of a product. So we just have to… At Tesla we have a real tendency to bite off more than we can chew on the car front. So we’ve got to make sure… We have a lot of irons in the fire here for new products like the Cybertrucks, Semi, new Roadster, and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world, and this brilliant Model Y, and Autopilot, and the solar roof and-"
New technologies.,"Yeah, exactly. Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack. We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage. More than we can supply, at least for 2020. [inaudible 00:02:35]."
"Thank you. And the last question from the retail is, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like the Hornsdale Power Reserve and Moss Landing instead of selling them battery storage? Does it make sense for Tesla to buy peaker plants and convert them?","Well, we haven’t really thought about that yet. So it’s not out of the question, but our brain is full. Excuse me, sir, our brain is full. I saw the question. Our overarching goal is to help accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. And the three elements of that are sustainable power generation, then you’ve got to store the power, stationary storage, and then you’ve got to have electric transportation."

It’s just to the degree that we can accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, we think that’s a fundamental good for the world and we want to do that as fast as possible. But it’s not, like I said, market share growth as a goal in and of itself. It’s just the faster this happens, the better off the world is."
"Thanks everybody. I hope everyone’s safe and healthy. I got one question; one follow-up. And I’ll point out, I’ve had a root canal before. And I would agree Elon, it was less painful than buying a car.","Exactly. I mean, it really is… Yeah, exactly."
"Yeah. It’s a big problem, actually. It’s a big problem.",It’s crazy. Yes.
"And as we’ve been looking at liquidity, we’ve been looking at this over the next 18 months and there’s ups and downs to the liquidity. Currently now, as we’re not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we’re paying off. But then in a couple of months we’ll quickly be through that and then we’ll have a gap in payables, since we don’t have any parts coming in. So it does go up and down a little bit. But in looking at the long term horizon, which is how we’re managing it right now, we feel pretty comfortable with the liquidity position of the company.","Yeah, yeah. I should say, we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area and that should be identified as a serious risk. We only have two car factories right now. One in Shanghai and one in the Bay Area. And the Bay Area produces the vast majority of our cars. All of S and X and most of the 3 and all of the Y. So the extension of the shelter-in-place, or, frankly, I would call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights, but that’s my opinion. And erasing people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came to America or built this country. What the fuck? Excuse me. People… The outrage, it’s just an outrage."

And while Tesla will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not. Everything people have worked for their whole life is being destroyed in real time. And we’re going to have many suppliers and are having many suppliers that are having super hard times, especially the small ones. And it’s just causing a lot of strife to a lot of people. Yeah."
"What would be your message to US lawmakers on this call as we, in addition to your opinions on shelter-in-place, but thinking of longer term, your message to US lawmakers coming out of the crisis? Specifically around EV infrastructure and a chance to kind of work with taxpayers to support sustainable transport, renewable energy. I’m wondering if you see this as a chance to make the crisis and all the loss and lives lost, not be in vain. Thanks.","I think it’s high time we invested in infrastructure in this country. We have a lot of crumbling highways and bridges. And frankly, when I visit China I see their infrastructure as being much better than ours; it’s great. Europe has better infrastructure. It’s really quite sad that the US infrastructure, especially sort of roads and highways, is where it is today. And our airports in a lot of cases are an embarrassment. And it’s not just a question of money, it’s a question of will. And as soon as we spend a lot of money on these things, but what do we gain for it?"

If this was 1920, do you want to be investing in steam engines or internal combustion engines? Obviously not steam engines. So this is a time to think about the future and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people’s rights? As what is happening right now? I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry. It’s just like, if somebody wants to stay in their house, that’s great. They should be allowed to stay in their house and they should not be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom."
"Hi. Good evening. Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is already positive at such low volume. How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model 3? What other factors should we think about and what does that mean for the ampler, for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?",Zach?
"On the cost side, and I think you hit on a couple of the buckets. The commonality is huge. It’s very important. And in addition to that, the manufacturing processes are very similar to Model 3 as well. And so we have experienced with that, both with Model 3 in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai. And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well. So the ecosystem to support and launch the product is there. There remain a lot of opportunities to continue to take cost out of the car. The number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to where we’ll go.","Yeah, it’s good. It will take cost out of the car and make the product better."
Exactly.,"So, it’s not make the part worse. Any fool can take cost out of a car, make it worse. We want to take cost out of the car, figure out how to make it lighter and simpler. And so, it’s we want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering cost. But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect the marginal cost of that car to be comparable to the Model 3 once we have reached say [pap 00:42:42] to 10 or 20,000 units or something like that. And have gone-"
Yeah. I was asking about Mr. Mizuno entering the board and kind of the process behind that and what he brings to the board.,"Oh, I think… Well, we all need a Hiro. But obviously he brings a tremendous amount of experience investing at the highest levels in the world and has done incredible work at the Japan pension fund, which is the largest funder of any kind in the world.

And generally the conversations over the years, he’s just shown an incredible insight into how the securities or the global security markets work and what he thinks is where the areas for reform. He just looks like to have a strong philosophical underpinning about how to make the future better. And shares that view regarding the environment, and just a very sensible, smart person who brings a lot to the board and I think is generally recognized as such by many people."
"I guess looking into the Panasonic relationship, maybe just how is that relationship going here? And is there any readthrough on bringing him onto the board? Thank you.","No, I think this is [inaudible 00:46:07] with the Panasonic relationship. I mean I have a great relationship with Panasonic CEO. We meet regularly one-on-one and talk all the time and so that relationship is strong. He would bring more of a broader and a global strategic view to the board."
"Congratulations on the progress, you talked about full autonomy by the end of the year. I would love for you to walk through the roll out strategy of the Tesla network app and how that’s going to look prior to the robo taxi stage. Are you going to gradually take over human routes with autonomous capable routes over time or how do you see that playing out?","Well, it’s pretty much going to play out as it has played out, which is will release more and more functionality. Before we release any functionality, it goes through extensive testing and of course we ramp up a simulations team that has a very good simulation of the real world. So we run any code changes through a battery of tests in simulation. Then we have a global QA team, which I’m on actually. I’m on the global QA team, and we test the releases in the real world, real world play out, the differences between the real world and the simulation which are very many because the world is very complex. And then we release it to a small group of private beta testers within the company, then to a larger beta audience including people outside the company, then to early access Tesla owners and then finally a broader release."

So by the time something is going to wide release into the US, it has gone through all of those stages, and the software that’s at the very early stage is much more vast than what people are seeing. So there’s just got to go through a very rigorous safety process. So essentially we need to figure out is if they’re very good at complex intersections, they’re very good at complex turns in intersections, and things like busy malls in a parking lot, or office park or special events and sporting events, that kind of thing, when those eventually come back. But yeah, those are extra hard cases but it’s all tracking very well. I feel like the auto pilot engineering team is, we just have an extremely talented group and I’m deeply involved with the team. So we talk every week and meet every week when we can, [inaudible 00:49:44] physical meetings difficult."

Then after that functionality is released, there’s still another step which is to improve the reliability of it. Once it’s released to kind of full self driving with humans supervision, supervised by the driver. And then we keep improving the reliability to the point where it no longer needs to be supervised by the driver and we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this was the case, and then presumably the regulators, depending on which jurisdiction it is, would give approval for fully autonomous cars that can drive with no human on board."

[crosstalk 00:51:03]."
"So to summarize, we’re going to get owner’s full autonomy, some level of that by the end of the year. And then a human in the loop, Tesla Network app sometime, is it first half of next year? Would that be the hope?",Do you mean like when can the car drive with no person?
"No, with a person. Initially a person to observe. Would that be, with the Tesla network app, would that be early part of the year? 2021, is that the hope?","If described as a hope, I would say that’s probably a fair description."
"Okay. And then kind of take it to its end stage, the robo taxi stage. Any high level thoughts, understand the regulatory is a massive unknown, but if you’re going to put a guess on it, where would we start when we started seeing robo taxis?","I think it’s quite likely in my view, [Danek 00:52:10] would say-"
"Robo taxi stage.

Because when I give a guess, I give the guess that I think is the likely mid point, not the point with lots of margin. If this is normal distribution, I’d give you the 50th percentile, not the [inaudible 00:08:02], optimistic or pessimistic. So then that really means at least half my predictions will be wrong and half will be right. Or might be right but offset by a few weeks to a few months, in some cases a few years. But I believe everything I’ve ever said would come true, did come true. It may come true late, but it did come true."

So I think we could see robo taxis in operation with network fleet next year. Not in your market, but it’s been in some."
"During the question and answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one followup. Please press star one now if you’d like to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon.","Thanks, Martin. Q4 was another strong quarter for the company. Deliveries reached over 112,000 vehicles in a single quarter. It’s hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with zero advertising spend. We do say that from time to time, and I think it’s often overlooked, but to have the highest demand electric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is, I think, quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without a bunch of advertising."

So there’s a lot of potential to go beyond that number."

This was thanks to a great effort of our engineering team. And we managed to achieve by far the highest energy efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced, at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y all-wheel drive got an EPA rating of 315 miles. This improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today. This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin. And just with great acceleration and top speed, it’s really just incredible specs all around."

So it really just, from the standpoint of what’s the most bad ass futuristic armored personnel carrier that kicks ass of any pickup truck, basically that’s the goal.

But in 2019, we managed to generate more than a billion dollars of free cashflow while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y in production.

If you look back 10 years from today to 2010, we will produce approximately 1,000 times more cars in 2020 than we produced in 2010, 1,000. And we have also Solarglass and Solar Retrofit and Powerwall, Powerpack, all those other things too. So where will we be in 10 years? Very exciting to consider the prospect."
"Thank you. We are going to take the first questions from retail investors compiled by Say Technologies. So the first retail investor question is: Since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass roofs from any of the large California home builders that you can share? What’s the 2020 targets for the number of Solarglass roof installations in California?","We are seeing, admittedly from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for the Solarglass roof. So it’s difficult to predict what that will be this year, except that the demand is very strong. And we are working also, not just through Tesla installers, but also through new home builders and through just the roofing industry in general, where there’s in North America on the order of four million new roofs per year. So we see a lot of interest."

So we see a lot of interest.","So it’s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the installation. But over time, I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to use Solarglass in one form or another. It’s really going to be a choice of do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without. I think people will want a live roof that generates power and looks good and lasts a long time, and it’s the future we want. So it will be a significant product, but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product, and there’s a lot of challenges to overcome. But they will be overcome, and this will be a major product line of Tesla. And the Buffalo factory is doing great."
"Thank you. Now, second question from retail shareholders is: Will you release the Tesla ride-hailing network app before full autonomy and change the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be drivers on the network? If so, when will this happen? Might want to target California airports first, also a good place to add Superchargers.","Sorry, that sounds like more question than one."
"Yeah, it’s a bit of a bundle, yeah.","Well, I think it probably will make sense to enable car-sharing in advance of the giant robotaxi fleet because the car-sharing can be done before a full self- driving is approved by regulators. So it’s probably something that we would enable before the full robotaxi is enabled. And it sounded like there were some other questions bundled in there."
Superchargers at airports.,"Oh, sure. Yeah, probably will have Superchargers in airports. Will have Superchargers wherever we see that there is a need for Superchargers."
"Yeah, thank you. The next question from retail investors is: How many California owners are currently insured with Tesla Insurance? What’s the target for Tesla Insurance in 2020? When will you start to significantly leverage the data you have from the fleet to lower the cost of your coverage? Will we get premium discount of certain percent?","Yeah, I mean, go ahead, Zach."
The last part of the question was will there be a discount for using autopilot with our cars?,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There will be."
The rate card for California Tesla Insurance already considers the safety features associated with autopilot.,"Right. But I think it would make sense for us to close the loop on higher use of autopilot fully reduces the insurance cost. It lowers the probability of injury. So I think insurance is going to be, I think, quite a major product of Tesla over time. The amount of money that people spend on car insurance is a remarkably big percentage of the cost of a car. You can lease a Model 3 right now for $400 a month, but a typical owner in California will be paying somewhere between 100 and $200 a month in insurance. So we’re talking about something which is maybe a quarter to half of the cost of the lease of the car is insurance."
"Right. But I think it would make sense for us to close the loop on higher use of autopilot fully reduces the insurance cost. It lowers the probability of injury. So I think insurance is going to be, I think, quite a major product of Tesla over time. The amount of money that people spend on car insurance is a remarkably big percentage of the cost of a car. You can lease a Model 3 right now for $400 a month, but a typical owner in California will be paying somewhere between 100 and $200 a month in insurance. So we’re talking about something which is maybe a quarter to half of the cost of the lease of the car is insurance.","And a lot of that insurance cost is just because the insurance companies don’t have good information about the drivers. And that there’s no good way to provide feedback where… it’s a very poor feedback mechanism, not in terms of insurance rates versus the actual way that the car is being driven. Whereas we can do that in real time. It’s a fundamental information advantage that insurance companies don’t have."
Thank you. The next question is: You set expectations that you would be feature complete on FSD by the end of 2019. Can you please provide an update on when will we see this with end users? Where are you in retrofitting the FSD computer to older models?,"Well, I mean, to be precise, I said I was hoping we would be complete with FSD by the end of last year. We got pretty close. It’s looking like we might be feature complete in a few months. Feature complete just means it has some chance of going from your home to work with no interventions. So it doesn’t mean the features are working well. It means it has above zero chance."

It means it has above zero chance.","I think that’s looking like maybe it’s going to be a couple months from now. And what isn’t obvious regarding autopilot and full self-driving is just how much work has been going into improving the foundational elements of autonomy. The core autopilots and Tesla autopilot software and AI team just is, I think, very strong and making great progress."

And what isn’t obvious regarding autopilot and full self-driving is just how much work has been going into improving the foundational elements of autonomy. The core autopilots and Tesla autopilot software and AI team just is, I think, very strong and making great progress.","… very strong and making great progress. We’re really only beginning to take full advantage of the autopilot hardware, the FSD hardware. I think the apparent progress as seen by consumers will seem to be extremely rapid, but actually what’s really gone over my head it seems, like I said, is just having the foundational software be very strong, having a really strong foundation. Then a really fundamental thing is moving to video training. In terms of labeling, labeling with video and all eight cameras simultaneously, this is a really, I mean in terms of labeling efficiency, arguably like a three order of magnitude improvement in labeling efficiency. For those who know about this, it’s extremely fundamental. We’re making great progress on that."
"Thank you. The last retail investor question comes from [Kendall 00:00:21:14]. It says, “Most retail investors seem to understand Tesla better than analysts and are risking a larger part of their own personal wealth on Tesla. Doesn’t it make sense to take mostly questions on these earnings calls from us via [inaudible 00:01:29]? Do you even have to take answer questions from analysts?","Well, I guess we don’t have to. I do think that a lot of the retail investors actually have deeper and more accurate insights than many of the big institutional investors and so may have better insights than many of the analysts. It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investor analysts and what some of the smaller retail investors predicted about the future of Tesla, you would probably get the highest accuracy and remarkable insight from some of those predictions."
"Okay. Now let’s switch to institutional shareholder questions. The number one question is, “You have spoken previously about Shanghai Giga being 65% lower CapEx per unit of capacity. Have you learned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective? If yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the longterm gross margin?”","Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead."
"If you add all of this up, our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model 3 in China relative to Fremont, but I think it’s also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus that we’re selling out of Shanghai is also lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont, from a price perspective. I’ve said this on previous earnings calls, I think it’s fair to expect the margin coming out of the Shanghai facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont.","Yeah. I think there’s a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially the affordable cars, the 3 and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are. It kind of makes sense, but what we’re doing or what happened during the past was really pretty silly in making cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe. This created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars so you’ve got a lot of finished goods sitting on the water or waiting at the port or going through customs. You’ve got tariffs, transport. Then the factory complexity in California is very high because you’ve got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe, sort of three different types of cars that are being built. It’s very complex. Just having a factory in China, a factory in North America, a factory in Europe, just that alone is a massive improvement in our fundamental operating efficiency that I think may not be fully appreciated."
Also on working capital.,"Yeah, absolutely."
"The next question from institutional investors is, “Given the recent run in the share price, why not raise capital now and substantially accelerate the growth in production, i.e., build a Giga factory? It’s an investment in Supercharger and customer service.”","Well, we’re actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly. If there’s any sensible way to spend money, we are spending it. There’s no artificial hold back on expenditures. Anything that I see that looks like it’s got good value for money, the answer is yes immediately. We’re spending money, I think, efficiently and we’re not artificially limiting our progress. Then despite all that, we are still generating positive cash. In light of that, it doesn’t make sense to raise money because we expect to [inaudible 00:26:52]."
"No, I completely agree with that. I think some of our learnings during the Model 3 launch period, where we grew too quickly and with too much complexity, and it held back our ability to continue to scale. Part of the journey that we’ve been on in 2019 is to unwind a series of unintentional bad processes that kind of accumulated in the company over time. That’s kind of what contributes to the reduction in OpEx over the year as we get smarter about that. Now we’ve laid a good foundation, I think. I agree with Elon that we’re not holding back on the growth. I mean, we have two vehicle products launching right now. That will consume much of the bandwidth of the company to stabilize those over the course of the year. Then looking into next year we have even more products launching, more factories.",Right. Yeah.
We want to be smart about how we spend money and grow in a way that’s sustainable so we don’t fall victim to the mistakes I think we made a year and a half or so ago.,"Yeah, absolutely."
"Okay. The last question from investors is, “To sales of Model S and X have stayed flat for several quarters. The main reason is that they still use 18650 batteries. When will S and X use 2170 batteries? Manufacturing capacity of 18650 may be used for battery storage systems instead.”","Sure. Well, actually the core chemistry inside the 18650 cell has improved many times over the years. It’s really just a form factor as opposed to a core technology. I think we’re pretty happy with the energy content of the cell and the improvements in efficiency of the vehicle. We’re rapidly approaching a 400 mile range for the Model S, for example. It won’t be long before Model S has a 400 mile range. Drew, is there anything you want to add?"
"No, other than to say that the 18650 lines have been running smoothly for a really long time. In a world where cell supply is fueling growth, we’re part of the fuel of growth. I don’t see a reason to turn that cell supply off.","Yeah. Actually, the Model S and X actually have more range than we are currently stating on the website. We just haven’t gotten around to updating I guess, the EPA sort of [crosstalk 00:31:10] number, but the actual range of the Model S and X are above what the website says they are."
That’s true.,Yeah.
The existing cars.,Huh?
The existing cars.,"Yeah, the existing cars that are being made."
Actually been that way for [crosstalk 00:31:27].,"Yeah, it must be somewhere in the 380s or something like that. [inaudible 00:31:35], yeah."
"Hi, everybody. Actually I agree, I think the retail questions were excellent actually. Elon, do you see potential for Tesla vehicles to be fitted with user terminals that are compatible with the Starlink constellation in the near or medium term future?","Well, it’s certainly something that could be happening in coming years. There’s no plans for it this year. The focus of Starlink is really for high bandwidth, low latency connectivity for homes and businesses and I guess aircraft and boats and that kind of thing, but the antenna for that high bandwidth, low latency thing is sort of about the size of medium pizza, which you could put on a car, but I think is more bandwidth than you would really need. I mean, technically, you could buy one and just stick it on the car. Yeah, it’ll work. I think it’s a great antenna."
"Maybe just as a follow up for my follow up, how would, assuming that we get the antenna form factor and cost down to a point where that could be integrated into the roof of a car, for example, cost-effectively and aerodynamically, et cetera, how would compatibility with a Starlink architecture theoretically improve the Tesla customer experience or the capability of the network?","Well, I think actually it’s most possible we’ll just use the cellular connectivity, just use 5G would be the recommendation, certainly in like any cities or something like that, but if you’re out in the countryside and there’s not good cell connectivity, then maybe you could connect with the Starlink antenna. You don’t need to like have like gigabit level connectivity. Probably like 20, 30 megabits is probably fine and then you can have a much smaller antenna. Yeah, I guess it could be good for making sure there’s connectivity outside of major cities and that kind of thing, but I mean, that’s sort of, I’d say, relatively obtuse. I’m not thinking about it very much, to be honest."
"Hey, good afternoon. Thanks. I’m hoping you could give us some guidance on what CapEx is going to be this year. As I look to model out the business longterm, is there a rule of thumb that we can use for capital expenditures per unit of production capacity or some sort of rule of thumb like that?","I don’t think we want to say what our CapEx is going to be this year, not necessarily, except to say like, as I said earlier, we’re spending money as fast as we can spend money in sensible ways. It’s definitely not artificially limited. We will spend a lot of money this year, for sure. The challenge comes in like finding efficient ways to actually deploy the capital, but that’s the harder part than sort of deciding on a CapEx number really."
I think we always find ways to become more CapEx efficient per unit of capacity.,"Yes, exactly. Yes."
We challenge the teams to always become more efficient. We see a reduction per unit in term of CapEx.,Absolutely.
We just don’t have the right metric.,"Yeah. Yeah. I think that there’s so much [inaudible 00:35:52] that the core technology is improving radically that maybe you wouldn’t necessarily notice as an end customer, or some of them where you’d notice, some of them you wouldn’t, but it’s just there are these things that have a big effect on the efficiency of the company, like our total applications team that kind of builds the Tesla internal operating system and approves the sort of core automation of the company. That makes a big difference to our productivity, but you wouldn’t necessarily … You would see it effectively in healthier financials, but you wouldn’t necessarily notice it as like an end customer."
"Yeah, I think-","[inaudible 00:37:17] for more than 30% percent, yeah."
"Yeah. I think the math … I’m not sure the math that you’ve done, but I think our eternal plans are for faster. Just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on CapEx in the 10K, but back to the growth rate. I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that the Shanghai facility, we do have a loan facility in place to support that growth, so that helps. Then as our production volumes increase, that generates more cash from the business as well that allows us to continue to fund additional factories. I wouldn’t necessarily view it as limited as you described it.","Yeah, I think a few years ago I said I … Yeah, I don’t know when it was, but years ago I just said my estimate is that Tesla would grow at an average rate of in excess of 50%. My soul holds that belief."
"Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress. First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you’ll sell as many as you can make. Can you remind me how many of you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those Cybertrucks?","Yeah, I think we don’t comment on those detailed numbers, except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make in the space of, I don’t know, three or four years, something like that. The thing we’re going to be really focused on is increasing the battery production capacity, because that’s very fundamental, because if you don’t improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting [inaudible 00:39:19] from one part to another, and you haven’t actually produced more electric vehicles. That’s probably the reason why we have not, for example, really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells. Unless we’ve got a lot of battery cells available, then say like accelerating production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making fewer Model 3 or Model Y cars. We’ve got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in that battery production and continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour for the batteries. This is very-"

This is very-","Cost per kilowatt-hour for the batteries. This is very fundamental and extremely difficult. So there we’re going to do kind of a battery day, just to kind of explain more about this and what our plans are. I think, probably, it’s going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter because I think this is going to be kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter. So you know, tentatively, sort of in the April timeframe, what we’ll do is do a battery day and kind of go through what the challenges are, you know? How do you get from here to, I don’t know, a couple thousand gigawatt hours a year or something."
"Great. I’ll look forward to that battery day. You also mentioned in your prepared comments about other products that may come up, and the only vehicle not announced for master plan part two is a high passenger-density vehicle. Any light that you can give us regarding that project?","Yeah. Going back to what I just said, we’ve got to improve the total battery capacity. Otherwise, we add complexity, but we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road. Will we do some sort of high capacity vehicle at some point? Probably, but we need to make sure we’ve got the batteries to make cars that we’ve already got, already on our plate."

Will we do some sort of high capacity vehicle at some point? Probably, but we need to make sure we’ve got the batteries to make cars that we’ve already got, already on our plate.","And it’s just generally true… I’ve seen some sensible comments by our ARK Invest, pointing out that, really, people do prefer to drive in their cars mostly by themselves. I mean, the average number of occupants in a car, I think, is like 1.2? Maybe with autonomy, maybe it’ll go to 1.4. Maybe, but I’m not sure if it even goes there."

Probably, but, like I said, we’ve got to solve this battery… We’ve got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even fathom today. That’s the real problem."
"Hey, guys, thanks for taking my call. I want to talk about the differences between the Model 3 and the Model Y, beyond the sort of 10% rule of thumb just around cargo and size. Are there other features that are going to differentiate the two models? And then, as a follow onto that, you’ve talked in the past about how [inaudible 00:43:00] sales grew with the introduction of Model X. So are you planning on setting up your production facilities to align with that thesis, that essentially Model 3 sales will expand alongside the introduction of Model Y?","We’re not quite sure what’s going to happen, but it is true that the instruction Model X actually increased Model S sales, because people would come in, they’d look at the Model X, and they’re like, ” Okay, I’d prefer the sedan.” And we’re worried that X sales would cause S sales to drop. They actually closed the increase. So from my standpoint, I… We’re not too worried about demand, we’re worried about production. Just make sure we get that production ramp going, and reach volume production as soon as possible with the Model Y. And talk to the… [inaudible 00:43:58] predict what that… The exponential part of the S-curve of production, the production pretty much always follows this S-curve, or it’s kind of a herky-jerky S-curve."
"We’re not quite sure what’s going to happen, but it is true that the instruction Model X actually increased Model S sales, because people would come in, they’d look at the Model X, and they’re like, ” Okay, I’d prefer the sedan.” And we’re worried that X sales would cause S sales to drop.

But that intermediate portion, the S-curve is very difficult to predict. So that involves a massive amount of hard work and just reacting fast to issues that arise. Yeah, I think we’re just going to go as fast as we can with the Model Y and make sure it’s a great product."
"And you can use it to predict what it’s going to be like in the beginning because it’s slow, and it’s used to predict what it’s going to be like at the end. But that intermediate portion, the S-curve is very difficult to predict. So that involves a massive amount of hard work and just reacting fast to issues that arise. Yeah, I think we’re just going to go as fast as we can with the Model Y and make sure it’s a great product.","I think there are some things that will differentiate it, but that’s not something we’re going to talk about in this call. I think when people do a tear down of the Model Y, I think they’ll be impressed about some of the things they see."
"And just to add to that, I think it’s important to keep the Model Y launch in context of the next 18 to 24 months. What we’re working on here between Berlin and Shanghai and Fremont is to have 3 and Y locally produced in all locations, and so Model 3 is expanding as Model Y is expanding. There may be ups and downs in various factories as we get to the journey of having these products on all the major continents.",Yeah.
"Thanks so much, guys. Can you speak to the pricing strategy in light of the China price reductions as well as the mission to increase UVA adoption? Is there a target for gross profit or operate profit on a per vehicle basis that we should be thinking about, or how should we really frame that for ourselves?","Yeah, I mean we’re trying to make the cars as affordable as possible, as fast as possible, while maintaining reasonable… While still being at least a little bit profitable, and growing the company like crazy and having good free cash flow and accumulating a cash balance. Anything you want to…"
"No, I think that’s very fair.",Yeah.
"I mean, our order rate supports the pricing that we have right now. We’re working very hard to reduce costs and expand production because it made me feel, from the data, it’s pretty clear that there’s a lot of interest in our products. And so what we’re working on is to increase production, increase of availability of the products with time. And the price reduction in China… Kind of the first step towards this global localization, more accessible price, and we’ll continue to work on cost reductions in China as we do in Fremont and grow production.","Yeah, I mean, the thing that’s really going to, probably just have a profound effect on our financials, is I guess high volume and high margin, obviously. And that high margin part comes from autonomy. So do people buy the full self-driving package or not, and do they buy it worldwide or only in certain places? For example, our autonomy is not as good in China as it is in the U.S., so fewer people, or a very small percentage of people, buy the FSD package in China. But as we fix that, then we’ll see a much higher percentage of people buying it. And as we get closer to full self-driving, that’s just going to become more and more compelling. So that’s, from a financial standpoint, that’s the real mind blowing situation is high volume, high margin, because of autonomy."
"Okay. And then, just shorter term, there’s significant discussion in the industry around moving to higher voltage on the powertrain and then some challenges around the supply chain’s preparedness to support that. Separate from the battery pack, since we’ll talk about that in a couple of months, can you speak to the areas of focus on powertrain technology-driven cost reduction over the next 12 to 24 months that we should be thinking about?","Well, our powertrain is pretty damn good. I mean it’s way better than anything else out there by a country mile. It’s worth noting, for example, that the Model S has a 100-kilowatt-hour pack. The Taycan has a what, like 95-kilowatt-hour pack. The Model S is steadily approaching 400 miles of range. The Taycan has 200 miles of range. So we must be using that energy pretty efficiently, and the powertrain is a big part of that."
"I would just say the focus is on costs on the powertrain. One more thing about technology innovations, it’s how do we continue to drive the cost down?",Yeah.
"And that’s through voltages. Maybe one angle, but there are certainly others that just enable more power density and lower cost.","Upside? Powertrain is mind blowing, I think. Yeah."
"Upside? Powertrain is mind blowing, I think. Yeah.","Coming out later this year, end of the year probably, that’s our goal. Get the powertrain out, end of the year, and then it’s going to be like, “This is like alien technology.” It’s insane."
It’s all about that.,"I didn’t even think we could do… Yeah, I mean honestly I thought it was no way. But it’s kick ass. It’s engineering team. Just tells a little about hardcore engineering."
"Hi, good evening, everybody. So, in your slide deck you had the comments around average selling price being stable or thereabouts in 2020. Can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes [inaudible 00:49:53] the metric evolve? Obviously you have the Model Y which probably would have initial higher pricing, and then, but the China Model 3’s at a lower price. So, I guess, what are the puts and takes for what you would see as sort of like stability [inaudible 00:50:08] in 2020?","[crosstalk 00:50:11] Yeah, but we don’t really ever comment on prices and stuff. I think we’ll adjust according to what the demand looks like. I mean, right now, it looks pretty good. Maybe that’ll change, who knows? Yeah."
"But I think the way you described it is fair. So I mean, relative to the current Model 3, China Model 3 pricing is slightly lower, and our Model Y pricing is public on the website. So you can see that it’s clearly slightly higher than what Model 3 is out of Fremont. How the mix of those three products, and that’s out over the course of the year, we’ll see. But I think it’s probably fair at the moment to assume the mix of those stays fairly stable in terms of ASP when you average them together.","Yeah. I mean, the affordability of our car in China improved radically because of tariffs mostly going away, which is tax exemption, local parts supply. Not having to spend a bunch of money to transport it over the ocean. So the affordability was night and day for our car in China."
"Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. Just want to follow up on the question on capital raise. So given the cheaper cost of capital, and this is a real competitive advantage for others, why wouldn’t it make sense to raise capital to either pay down debt or to pursue acquisitions? Especially bolt-ons that could help you accelerate capabilities in autonomous or battery technology.","All right. If you know of any acquisitions, we’d love to hear about them. Yeah, sure. Sounds great. Who should we acquire?"
"Well, given the importance of autonomous, I imagine that this is an area that you would want to accelerate if you view it as a crucial competitive advantage.",We’re not aware of anyone that we’d want to acquire.
And debt paydown?,Letting the company to pay down debt doesn’t sound like a wise move.
"I think the broader… There’s been a couple of versions of this question over the course of the call, and I think what we’re saying more broadly is that, as we look forward on the cash generation from the business relative to what our plans are, we are not constrained.","Yeah. We’re going to pay down the debt, just as time goes by, and we paid down half a billion dollars worth of debt last quarter. So we’ll just keep steadily paying it down, and yeah. So…"
"Yeah. We’re going to pay down the debt, just as time goes by, and we paid down half a billion dollars worth of debt last quarter. So we’ll just keep steadily paying it down, and yeah. So…","But yeah, I don’t think we have anything more to say on that front, really."
"Hey, thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to come back on batteries and if I look at the end of this year, you should have [inaudible 00:53:36] and then you have your [inaudible 00:53:47] It means you need plenty north of 16 gigawatt-hour of battery production capacity. So where do you stand now and how do you get there? And then it [inaudible 00:53:58] like your competitors or groups who would like to compete, because you seem to be struggling to grow a battery capacity. So if you can just take us through what you’re doing differently. Why you have confidence you can do that if it looks like nobody has done.","Well, I guess a lot of people sort of made fun of us for not being able to grow both cars and both capacity and it’s like now it turns out actually even the pros have trouble with it. You know, it’s pretty hard. So you know, but the fact is we’ve already demonstrated massive growth and cell production capacity at our Gigafactory in Nevada, and you have to go from the cells to the modules to the pack. So they’ve started at cell capacity but also module and impact capacity. So we’ve just gotten pretty good at that, and it worked well with [inaudible 00:55:03] like Panasonic how’s our relationship has been, it’s been excellent. They’ve been a great partner with us for many years. We’ve added some additional partners at a smaller scale."

We’ve got a very compelling strategy. I mean, we are super deep on cell, and cell through battery. So. So module battery. [inaudible 00:55:40] anything you want to add to that?"
"Thanks, but you’ve said it all.","We are super deep. Rabbit holes. That rabbit hole goes down pretty far seven days a week working out its own days, weekend after production. Man, do we know a lot about batteries. Geez."
"I think I can see that. The only thing that I would add is, you know we, we do have a decade plus of experience of not just what a cell should be, but how to integrate it into the product and that’s really helped.","Yeah, absolutely. And how to manage those, the cell and the module and the battery and through different weather conditions and different environmental and different charge regimes and wow, we really know a lot about batteries. Yeah. The next level."
"Further to the conversation around the cell technology… I was just wondering if you can comment on what the plans are for the Maxwell technology that you acquired, either as a capacitor or dry cell or what have you. Thanks.","Well, like I said, we’re going to talk about this on battery day, which is probably April, and then a lot of these questions will be answered. I think it’s going to be a very compelling story that we have to present. I think it’s going to actually blow people’s minds. It blows my mind and, you know, I know it. So it’s going to be pretty cool."
"Maxwell’s… Maxwell, that ultra cap technology is kind of part of the plan.","It’s an important piece of the puzzle. Yes. I think some of this, those sort of retail investors have managed to put together several pieces of the puzzle. They seem to have the most insight."
I shall have to read the blogs more. Thank you.,"All right, you’re welcome."
"Thank you very much for everyone, for all of your good questions, and we will speak to you in another three months. Thank you.",Thank you.
" It is Halloween night, and I have gotten my treat, which I’ve been asking for a while. I’m here with Elon Musk at the headquarters of Tesla. Is that right? The right pronounce? Is it Tesla or Tezla?"," Tesla, yeah. "
Whatever. ,"By the way, I think your costume is great."
"I’m here with delicious coffee. We are gonna have a long discussion about all kinds of things. Elon’s been very nice to do this in the evening, here. We’ve been chatting about all kinds of things, but we’re gonna get into it really quick. We’re gonna talk about Tesla, we’re gonna talk about SpaceX, we’re gonna talk about this year, we’re gonna talk about The Boring Company, and anything else Elon wants to talk about, because people like to hear you talk. ",Using Twitter without a filter
"Let’s start from the beginning, about this year. You’ve given some very interesting interviews. You’ve gotten on Twitter, made some mistakes.",What’s Twitter?
"What’s Twitter? Okay, let’s start with Twitter. I have an obsession with Twitter, too, and an addiction. How do you look at that with you? What is going on?",What’s going on? 
What happens? What happens with you and Twitter?,"Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter. "
And why?,"I find it entertaining. I think, “Oh, other people might find this entertaining.” Sometimes they do. "
And sometimes ...,Yeah. It’s pretty random. 
"Just at night? What are you, at home you’re doing this?",Yeah. Mostly at home. I spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think. It’s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something. 
"Yeah, well people pay attention when you do that. ","Yeah. It’s pretty interesting what my most ... What people are most interested in, like some little tweet about “I love anime.” That was it. But it was lowercase “i”, black heart, “anime,” and people loved that. That was like one of my most popular tweets. "
What about the things they didn’t love? Are you under strict orders not to do that? Is that correct? Will you be? Will you have to change your Twitter behavior?,Not really. 
Not really. ,"Under the recent settlement, you don’t have to be careful about what you tweet? If it’s anime, that’s one thing."
"Under the recent settlement, you don’t have to be careful about what you tweet? If it’s anime, that’s one thing.",Mm-hmm.
But if it’s just business you can’t.,"No, I think it’s mostly just if it’s something that might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours. That’s about it. "
That’s about it. So you can’t do that.,"Without somebody getting mad, no. "
"That’s a lot of people getting mad. Would you consider it ... I’m gonna get off it in a second, but do you consider it a communications medium? How do you look at it? A lot of us use it that way. I use it that way. Obviously, Donald Trump uses it that way. How do you look at it?","I look at it as a way to learn things, kinda stay in touch with what’s happening. It feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society. That’s what it feels like. It’s kinda weird. I guess I sometimes use Twitter to express myself, and that’s a weird thing to do, I suppose. "
"Not so much. It isn’t. Sometimes it’s very funny, other times it’s not so funny.",Some people use their hair to express themselves; I use Twitter. 
"All right. But when you do it in ... I’m not going to get to the SEC ‘cause I understand you can’t talk about that very much. Nothing to do with that. Although you did tweak them in one of your tweets, but at some point that will stop. Correct?",What did I say?
"You made some remark. Elon, there’s so many tweets that you do that are so obnoxious, it’s hard to know. That was an obnoxious tweet.",It was?
"Yes, it was.",Oh. 
Don’t do that. ,I was just ... I forgot which one it was.
"Yeah, but —",Can you remind me?
"No. It’s like you had some name ... Look it, you’re cackling on Halloween! ",Picking fights with the press
"But the ones that I think I do want to ask about is the press. You pick fights with the press over Twitter, and then you have all your fans, of which there are many. Are you aware of what they do once you start them off?","Well, I have to say, my regard for the press has dropped quite dramatically."
"Explain that, please.","The amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable. Take that Wall Street Journal front-page article about like, “The FBI is closing in.” That is utterly false. That’s absurd. To print such a falsehood on the front page of a major newspaper is outrageous. Like, why are they even journalists?  "
Do you understand —,They’re terrible. 
Do you hear — understand the mood in this country ...,Terrible people.
"I get that, but do you understand the mood in this country around the press and the dangers of attacking, especially when the president is doing that? In quite an aggressive, “enemy of the state” and everything else. It’s disturbing when someone like you as a leader does that, too, or goes along with it.","The answer is for the press to be honest and truthful, and research their articles and correct things properly when they are false. Which they don’t do. "
Okay. But I’m asking if you understand where it goes to.,"Yes, of course I do."
What do you think of that? Are you worried about unleashing a dangerous cycle that a lot of the press are worried about? Justifiably. ,I suggest the press take it to heart and do better. 
"What about what Donald Trump does, about “enemy of the people”? Do you look at it that way?",No. 
Just that you don’t like falsehoods.,"Yeah. There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it’s gonna get. Then somebody is not a journalist, they are an ad salesman. Not a journalist, an ad salesman. "
What about things that are just critical of you that you don’t like? Do you think you’re particularly sensitive? ,"No. Of course not. Count how many negative articles there are and how many I respond to. One percent, maybe. But the common rebuttal of journalists is, “Oh. My article’s fine. He’s just thin-skinned.” No, your article is false and you don’t want to admit it. "
Do you take criticism to heart correctly?,Yes.
Give me an example of something if you could.,How do you think rockets get to orbit?
That’s a fair point.,"Not easily. Physics is very demanding. If you get it wrong, the rocket will blow up. Cars are very demanding. If you get it wrong, a car won’t work. Truth in engineering and science is extremely important. "
Right. And therefore?,I have a strong interest in the truth. 
All right. And you are —,Much more than journalists do. 
"What I’m trying to get to is, do you want to acknowledge when you do this it does set off ... People beyond you that listen to you, you have a fan base that’s quite rabid, I would say.","No, I wouldn’t say that. "
No? ,I think they’re great. 
All of them?,"No, not all of them. "
Right. Okay. ,The “excruciating” year of 2018
"Let’s talk about this year. What has gone on this year with you? It’s a very roller-coaster year. How would you explain it? You did a very emotional interview in the New York Times, and I promise we’ll get to Tesla and all the other things we want to talk about, but what has happened to you this year? How would you put it?",It’s been a very difficult year. 
Why is that? ,"We had the Model 3 production ramp, which was excruciatingly difficult. It is incredibly difficult to survive as a car company. Incredibly difficult. People have no idea how much pain people at Tesla went through, including myself. It was excruciating. "
And?,Excruciating.
And talk about that toll.,"Pretty sure I burnt out a bunch of neurons during this process. Running both SpaceX and Tesla is an incredibly difficult ... You realize we’re fighting the incredibly competitive car companies. They make very good cars. They’ve been doing this for a long time. They are entrenched. Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Lexus, you name it. All those car brands. And the history of car companies in America is terrible. The only ones that haven’t gone bankrupt are Tesla and Ford. That’s it. Everyone else has gone bankrupt. "
"So, the pressure of doing this. ",Yes. 
Why is it that you do this?,It’s trivial to start a car company.
Absolutely. ,It is insanely difficult to make it successful. 
"You put too much pressure on yourself this year, or it just is what you’re doing?",It sounds like you’re not hearing me. 
"I’m hearing you. I understand it’s incredibly difficult. What I’m saying is why did you do it this way, this year?",You’re definitely not understanding me.
All right. Try it again. ,"Making a car company successful is monumentally difficult. There have been many attempts to create a car company and they have all failed, even the ones that have had a strong base of customers, thousands of dealers, thousands of service centers, they’ve already spent the capital for the factories, like GM and Chrysler, still went bankrupt in the last recession. Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession. There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession. So, as a startup, a car company, it is far more difficult to be successful than if you’re an established, entrenched brand. It is absurd that Tesla is alive. Absurd! Absurd. "
What do you credit that to?,Excruciating effort. 
By you and —,Hundred-hour weeks by everyone. 
By everyone here at Tesla. ,Yes. There wasn’t some other way to do this. 
That’s what I’m saying —,"There wasn’t some other way to do this, Kara. "
While you’re also running a space company and other ones. ,Yes.
Yes.,Why does Musk push himself so hard?
What I want to get at is why you’re doing that. It’s not a trivial … Why do you think you want to push yourself that hard? ,"Well, the other option would have been, Tesla dies. "
Right.,"Yeah. Tesla cannot die. Tesla is incredibly important for the future of sustainable transport and energy generation. The fundamental purpose, the fundamental good that Tesla provides is accelerating the advent of sustainable transport and energy production. "
"Which I think most people credit you for doing. Pushing everyone else into it at the same time, correct?","Yes. The success of Tesla is, by far, the biggest forcing function for the other car makers to get into —"
100 percent.,Yeah. Into electric cars. They’ve said so. 
"No, there’s no question. I was just having a discussion with someone the other day, and I said, “He has pushed everybody into this, really dramatically. There wouldn’t have been this much investment. There wouldn’t have been this.” ","Yes. It’s very important for the future of the world. It’s very important for all life on Earth. This supersedes political parties, race, creed, religion, it doesn’t matter. If we do not solve the environment, we’re all damned. "
And this way via sustainable transportation.,"Yes. It sort of blows my mind, all these social justice warriors driving around in diesel cars. It’s outrageous. Do you have an electric car?"
I do not. I have a —,Shame on you.
Ford Fiesta. ,Okay.
"I’m trying to get rid of my car, actually. I’m trying to actually get rid of it.t",Sure. I’m shaming you into buying you an electric car. 
"No, I would think, too —",I’m really car-shaming you.
No. I don’t drive my car very much. It sits in the garage. I try not to drive my car at all.,Driving something. 
When you get to this ... You’re doing this to yourself because you think that the world depends ... Not the fate of the world. You’re not a cartoon character. ,"No, I think the electrification of transport, and there’s also an important part of Tesla which is solar and stationary batteries, because you need to generate electricity in a standard, sustainable way with solar and then store it at night when the sun goes down with batteries, and then use that energy from the sun to power cars. Without Tesla, this would still happen. There would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer. History will judge this, obviously, but I would say on the order of 10 years, maybe 20 years."
"So, pushing it forward by that much.","Yes. I think it’s probably fair to say that Tesla has advanced sustainable energy by at least five years, conservatively, and maybe closer to 10, and then if we continue to make progress, we might advance it by 20 years. This could be all the difference in the world. "
"Yes. I think it’s probably fair to say that Tesla has advanced sustainable energy by at least five years, conservatively, and maybe closer to 10, and then if we continue to make progress, we might advance it by 20 years. This could be all the difference in the world. ",The toll on Musk and Tesla’s employees
What is the toll on you? What has been the toll on you and your employees? How do you think about that? ,"It’s been terrible. This year felt like five years of aging, frankly. The worst year of my entire career. Insanely painful."
"Was there any other way to do it? You didn’t think there was any other way to have it happen? Why this year? Why this year, of all the others? Because you’ve been at this for many years.","For this past year, it’s been because of the Model 3 production ramp. Myself and others at Tesla, we had to go in and fix the mistakes in the Model 3 production system, and there were a lot of them. I personally solved a bunch. Jerome [Guillen] solved a bunch. Everyone helped, the entire team. Javier [Verdura], Franz [von Holzhausen], Deepak [Ahuja], everyone. It was ... like, we had the legal team delivering cars in Q3. Todd [Maron] is great. There was a lot of people ... Everyone had to basically go hardcore to solve the ramp. "
To solve this ramp problem. ,"The amount of money that you lose if you don’t solve the ramp is mind-boggling, because you get hit from both sides. Let’s say you’re selling software or something, you don’t —"
"That would be easier, Elon. ","It would be a lot easier. But in software you don’t have a bunch of parts. You don’t have a supply chain. If you don’t sell software, you lose the revenue, but you don’t incur a massive amount of cost associated with producing the software, ’cause you just make copies pretty easily. "
"It would be a lot easier. But in software you don’t have a bunch of parts. You don’t have a supply chain. If you don’t sell software, you lose the revenue, but you don’t incur a massive amount of cost associated with producing the software, ’cause you just make copies pretty easily. ","But for any large, complex, manufactured item, you have an entire supply chain, and that supply chain has on the order of six months of inertia. You place the order for parts for the car, including if you’re all the way with like two or three or four suppliers ... We have on the order of 10,000 suppliers. It’s a crazy number. We have to place the orders for how many cars we think we’re gonna build roughly six months in advance, six months before final assembly, ’cause if you go all the way down the supply chain... "

","Then if you don’t actually make those cars, you still have all the costs. It’s like a flotilla of supertankers. The inertia of that is incredible. If anything happens to stall out the production progress, and that could be any one of those 10,000 suppliers, or on the order of 10,000 internal processes, if any of those is slow or wrong or whatever, you can’t make cars. You only need one missing thing, and whatever the slowest, least lucky part of the production process is, that sets your rate. "

"I want to get into Tesla specifically, and about the recent results, which I think people were surprised by. You surprised Wall Street and some of your competitors. But when you’re thinking about doing this incredibly complex thing, do you regret some of the things you’ve done to slow it down itself? Or was that unavoidable from your perspective? You know, some of your tweets. You attract attention. You really truly do, and some of it is self-inflicted. Do you not see it that way?","Yeah, there’s no question there’s, like, self-inflicted wounds. In fact, my brother said, “Look, if you do a self-inflicted wound, can you at least not twist the knife afterwards?” You stabbed yourself in the leg. You don’t really need to twist it in your leg. Why do that?"
So why do you do that?,It’s not intentional. 
"Well, okay. ","Sometimes you’re just under a lot of pressure, and —"
Your brother is wise.,"You’re not getting much sleep, you’re under massive pressure, and you make mistakes."
Is that over? Do you feel like that’s over? Do you feel calmer now?,It’s totally over. I will never make another mistake again.
"No, I’m teasing you. But how do you ... You look well. You don’t look under a lot of pressure. You seem rested. ","Yeah. Things are back to a hard work schedule, but not an insane work schedule. I was, there were times when, some weeks ... I don’t know. I haven’t counted exactly, but I would just sort of sleep for a few hours, work, sleep for a few hours, work, seven days a week. Some of those days must have been 120 hours, or something nutty. You’re gonna go a little bonkers if you work 120 hours a week. Now we’re down to 80 or 90. It’s pretty manageable."
"And you had talked in the New York Times about using Ambien and stuff like that. That was to regulate your sleep, correct? ",Yeah. It’s not like for fun or something. 
"No, not at all. ","No, it’s just like, if you’re super-stressed, you can’t go to sleep. You either have a choice of, like, okay, I’ll have zero sleep and then my brain won’t work tomorrow, or you’re gonna take some kind of sleep medication to fall asleep. "
"Now you’re to 80 hours, so it’s like totally manageable in that regard. ","Yeah, 80 or 90 ..."
You’re just like a regular lawyer in that regard. What is that? I think I’m about 80. I think I’m probably about —,Yeah. 80 is pretty sustainable. 
Sustainable for you.,Yeah. The pain level for hours increases exponentially. It’s like nonlinear above 80. 
Yeah. The pain level for hours increases exponentially. It’s like nonlinear above 80. ,Tesla’s first profitable quarter in two years
"Let’s talk about Tesla in specific. You turned in a great quarter. These cars are moving off. How do you look at where you’re going with the Model 3 and others? Then I want to get into some of the new features, the navigation features on Autopilot and things like that. How do you look at Tesla right now? I want to first talk about the product, and then talk about the company itself and what you need to move forward. ","I think at Tesla we’re doing pretty well right now. Tesla’s not staring death in the face. We’re in, I think, a pretty good position. We don’t want to be complacent, but it’s not ... Up until around September, we were really faced with, like, “We must solve this or we’re gonna die,” constantly. I feel like we’re no longer in the staring-death-in-the-face situation. "
"What, is death over and sitting in a seat nearby? ","Well, you never want to get complacent, so we still need to work hard, but I think we’re over the hump. We’re certainly over the hump on Model 3 production. For us, making 5,000 cars in a week for Model 3 is not a big deal. That’s just normal. Now we’re working on raising to 6,000 and then 7,000 Model 3s a week, while still keeping costs under control. We could probably do 6,000 or more, maybe 6,500 Model 3s a week right now, but it would have to stress people out and do tons of overtime. "
"What about innovations to these models? We’re not talking about other products coming out, but you put in a number of innovations in all the current models. ","Our cars are constantly being updated with new technology, so we don’t really have a model year like other car companies. As soon as we come up with some improvement, we just roll it into production. "
"Our cars are constantly being updated with new technology, so we don’t really have a model year like other car companies. As soon as we come up with some improvement, we just roll it into production. ",Self-driving cars
Talk about the new navigation feature. ,Drive on Navigation?
Right.,"That’s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving. You can enter in an address, and from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, the car will change lanes. It will go from one highway to the next automatically, and take off-ramp automatically. It’s pretty wild. It’ll overtake a slow car. It’s basically integrating navigation with the Autopilot capability. That’s why we call it Navigate on Autopilot or Drive on Nav."
"What are the challenges that you face with these technologies now, from your perspective?","Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras. There are eight cameras: Three forward, two on each side, and one rear. We’re running essentially eight neural nets of varying complexity. We’ve got to integrate the output of the neural nets into path-planning and then hook in the navigations, say, “Where do you need to go?” The big challenge has been solving a wide range of corner cases. So if you have a —"
These are things that just happen. ,"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line. Sometimes tar seams look like a line. Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason. One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center. And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection. "

"Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing. ",Government regulation
"What about regulations? The regulatory environment right now? Because that’s gonna be part of it, or else building out infrastructure that will have sensors in roads or things like that? How do you look at that, or you’re just not even thinking about it?","Yeah, we’re not really thinking about it. We’re assuming that there won’t be —"
You’re not assuming.,"No. The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver. Eyes are basically just cameras. All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras. A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away. There’s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras. "
"You don’t need anything else, from the government or from infrastructure or anything. I was recently talking to the Mercedes people. They were talking about sensors in the roads.","Yeah, that’s hopeless. That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide. "
"That works worldwide. How do you look at the regulatory environment, because that’s another thing you have to be dealing with? Here in the U.S., in China, wherever else.","I think the key thing for convincing regulators that self-driving is OK is to show billions of miles with a much better statistical significance in safety than human drivers. If the probability of injury is half that of the average human driver, then I think, probably, regulators will support self-driving. But it has to be a very large population. The statistical population of miles has to be very big, like billions, in essentially almost every possible case. "
"How do you assess different countries? This country versus China versus others? Who do you think is more ahead in that, at least helping these things come to fruition?","Again, we’re assuming that’s ... We’re assuming that nothing is done on the road side, but from a regulatory standpoint, I think it’s just gonna be who ... You know, which regulatory agency has the best appreciation of statistics."
And who is that right now?,"Actually, China’s pretty good. I think the U.S. is pretty good."
Any states or the federal? The federal system?,"I hope this is a federal system, because otherwise it’s gonna get weird when you cross state borders, and then you’re in a different situation."
"Suddenly in Arkansas, you can’t drive.","Yeah, I mean especially like in, say, East Coast, you’re going from like, you know, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire. Like you go through like several states pretty quickly, and then you wouldn’t wanna have things be different in each state."
So have you been working with federal regulators — Elaine Chao and ...,"Yeah, not ... Yeah. We certainly have a close relationship with NHTSA, especially, so like the ... You know the sort of hardcore, sort of the entity that really is the hardcore regulator of road transport is NHTSA. NHTSA sort of —"
Is where you’re gonna rely on it.,"Yeah, they’re like the regulator of cars, really."
"Yeah, they’re like the regulator of cars, really.",Tesla’s competitors
"Now other competitors, I’d love you to sort of assess the competitive landscape. Faraday just lost another founder today, which was the hot company, or the allegedly hot company, I think that’s probably easier to say it that way. Lucid got a billion dollars from SoftBank.","Saudi Arabia, not SoftBank."
"And there’s lots of others, but there’s all kinds of things. How do you assess — Google’s working on stuff, Uber still seems to be hanging in there. Or I don’t know what you think about that. I’d love to get your assessment of all of them. Or some of them.","Yeah. I don’t really think that much about competitors. I just say like, you know, how do we make our cars as good as possible? How do we make sure we have like the best engineering and manufacturing talent in the world?"
"Yeah. I don’t really think that much about competitors. I just say like, you know, how do we make our cars as good as possible? How do we make sure we have like the best engineering and manufacturing talent in the world?","You know, Tesla doesn’t do any advertising, or we don’t do any paid endorsements, we don’t sort of haggle for cars or anything like that. So we’re really reliant on the quality of product to sell. And I think it makes sense to sort of put our budget into advancing the technology to make the best possible cars."
Right.,"So, you know that’s ... I’m not sure looking at competitors really helps. It’s sort of like the old adage with, you know, running, you don’t wanna ... If you start looking at the other runners, it’s not good, you know."
Right. ,Like you can lose races because of that.
"Do you think about them? Do you think about them at all? Like Ford or Mercedes or anyone? Or if they’re doing anything that’s interesting, or Google? Which one of them, do you think, is the furthest ahead or closest to you all?","I mean self-driving, maybe Google, Waymo? I don’t think anyone is close to Tesla in terms of achieving a general solution for working on —"
Overall solution.,"Yeah. Yeah. You can definitely make things work like in one particular city or something like that by special-casing it, but in order to work, you know, all around the world in all these different countries where there’s, like, different road signs, different traffic behavior, there’s like every weird corner case you can imagine. You really have to have a generalized solution. And best to my knowledge, no one has a good generalized solution except ... and I think no one is likely to achieve a generalized solution to self-driving before Tesla. I could be surprised, but..."
So none of the car companies. None of the car companies. ,No.
"Do you ever look and go, “Okay, that’s interesting what they’re doing there.”","The other car companies ... I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving. "
"The other car companies ... I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving. ","You know, I think we’ll get to full self-driving next year. As a generalized solution, I think. But that’s a ... Like we’re on track to do that next year. So I don’t know. I don’t think anyone else is on track to do it next year."
No one even close. When you look at all the competitors?,"Not that I’m ... I think there’s ... I would say, unless they’re keeping it incredibly secret, which is unlikely, I don’t think any of the car companies are likely to be a serious competitor."
"Will they ever be a serious competitor, from your perspective?","In self-driving, I don’t think so. They’re just not good at software. And this is a software problem."
"Okay. All right, so talk about Tesla ... and then I want to get to SpaceX and other things.","It’s a harder problem, too, on the compute side. But they’re also not doing anything on the compute side."
Right.,So it’s like ... You do need an advanced sort of AI computer that’s very good at doing matrix multiplication with localized memory. So that —
"So they’re missing elements? What you’re saying, the generalized solution?","Yeah, I mean ... you need a specialized inference engine. Like the Tesla hardware 3 Autopilot computer, that will start rolling into production early next year, is 10 times better than the next best system out there at the same price, volume and power consumption. And it’s really because it’s got a dedicated neural net chip. Which basically, it sounds complicated, but it’s really like a matrix multiplier with a local memory."
"So all I’m getting at, is you don’t think any of the rivals will come close. Any of the ones that are touting their solutions?","I would say close to zero percent, probably."
"Okay. All right, that’s not close. That’s not close at all.",Yeah.
Okay.,This is my honest ... This is —
"That’s all right, that’s your answer.","This is just my ... what I think. I mean, I’m not ... it’s not like ... I could be wrong, but this is what I think."
"This is just my ... what I think. I mean, I’m not ... it’s not like ... I could be wrong, but this is what I think.",Why Tesla is not going private after all
"All right. So the challenge you face is financial, though. Getting funding and stuff like that. And you’ve gotten ... Saudis had bought a big bunch of your stock, that’s just separate, they —","They might have sold it, I don’t know."
"Yeah, we don’t know what they have now. But where do you get the money? Talk about the finances of doing this, because that’s what could really hurt you is not having enough capital.","You know ... I mean, as I said earlier this year, I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward."
All quarters going forward. So do you need more investment?,No.
Not at all.,I don’t think so.
Do you need to go private? Are you still contemplating that?,"We don’t need to go private, I think I .... going private would ... I think we could execute better if we were private."
Without all the attention?,"Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like one percent [or] less of time thinking about them —"
"It’s the tweets, Elon. But go ahead.",Less than one percent of my tweets have anything to do with short-sellers.
"You do know when you tweet, it’s louder than other people’s tweets, but go ahead.","Yeah, but if like one in a hundred is about short-sellers, that’s still 1 percent."
"Okay, all right. Okay. All right. Okay.",I think that’s like probably even less than that.
Okay.,"But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall. "
"But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall.

Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama, but if we can avoid the distraction of ... If we can avoid the brand damage of ... Let’s say we’re private, and then we went public five years from now. Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place. That was the approximate calculus. And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company’s a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot."
Right. It just roared upward this week. Or this past week.,"Yeah, yeah. It’s gone up. You know, it tends to end up being like a mood, to some degree, a mood thermometer. So it’s like the stock goes down, people are sad and feel undercompensated. And then when the stock goes up, people are exuberant, overly exuberant, and —"
Normal.,"Yeah, you get distracted thinking about what you’re going to buy."
"Right, right.","So, like, neither of these things are great. When you have big moves in the stock, this just causes a distraction."
"Right. Do you believe you have enough investment? Even if it’s cash-flow positive, you wanna invest more. Correct? Do you believe, do you think you need more investment?",No.
No. That you can do it based on selling these cars?,Yes.
Yes.,"The Tesla Semi, pickup truck and other new products"
"Okay. All right, so last thing on this, on Tesla, these new products. The truck, the Roadster, where are they?","Yeah, I’m super-excited about the future —"
Do you have another thing you’re making?,Ha-ha. We definitely do.
Do you have a vertical lift and takeoff?,"The supersonic VTOL jet, electric jet."
"Yeah. Perhaps a hovercraft like Larry Page, I don’t know.","No, hovercrafts are pretty straightforward."
"Yeah. Okay, sure.",But —
For you.,"A supersonic vertical-takeoff-and-landing electric jet would be interesting to do at some point, I think. But my head would definitely explode if I tried to do that right now."
"Yeah, I think so.",But I’ve been thinking about that design for nine years.
Do you have something special —,Yeah.
"Yeah, such as?",It’s great. 
It’s great? It’s in your head?,Yeah.
"Okay, all right.","I mean, I wrote down some of it, but ... "
But the truck is more immediate?,There were like a few things —
[And] the Roadster?,"Yeah, I think what fires me up about Tesla is, I think we’ve got the most exciting product roadmap of any company in the world."
Okay.,"We’ve got the Model Y, the compact ... midsize, more midsize SUV. The Tesla Semi, which is gonna be great for taking ... Because semis are in constant use and use a tremendous amount of fuel, so the Tesla Semi, I think, can have a huge effect, positive effect on —"
"When do those come online? That was a very dramatic opening of bringing it in, by the way. People are obsessed with your jackets, but it actually was the event that you did, where you showed it off.",Nice jacket.
"Yeah, nice jacket.",“Who are you wearing?”
Were you surprised by that? It was a nice jacket.,"It’s my favorite jacket, actually. I’ve had it for ages."
Okay. But suddenly it was the jacket.,"The reason it looks like ... It looks kind of worn-out, it’s ’cause it is."
Okay. All right.,"It’s not, like, accidentally. It’s that’s how —"
"All right, back to the truck!","All right, yeah. Exactly. Just to recap the things that are coming out, because I think it is ... I think it’s literally the most exciting product lineup of any company in the world. Certainly from a consumer standpoint. I’ll just go through the things that are publicly announced."

"The pickup, or the more-","Well, like let’s say that the fastest, top-speed cars in the world are still gasoline sports cars. So I think we ...

Why’s that?,"Well I can’t talk about the details, but it’s gonna be like a really futuristic like cyberpunk, “Blade Runner” pickup truck."
"OK, what does that mean?","It’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna be amazing."
Who are you trying to sell that to?,"This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It’s like, oh, it’s great."
Who do you wanna sell that to? People that buy F- whatever?,"You know, I actually don’t know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not, but I don’t care."
Okay.,"I mean I do care, eventually, you know. Like sure, I care. We wanna get gasoline, diesel pickup trucks off the road."
Right.,"But if I find, like, you know, I’m personally super-excited by this pickup truck. It’s something I’ve been wanting to make for a long time. And I’ve been iterating sort of designs with Franz ... It’s like I really wanted something that’s like super-futuristic cyberpunk. Which, if it doesn’t ... if I’m weirdly like ... if there’s only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we’ll make a more conventional truck in the future. But it’s the thing that I am personally most fired up about. It’s gonna have a lot of titanium."
"Titanium, okay. What else?","There’s like, you’ll see. It’s like ..."
"Racing stripes? What, no? I’m teasing, I’m teasing.","No, it’s gonna be ... Like, I think this is the kinda thing the consumer would want to buy, even if they don’t normally buy a pickup truck."
Right.,"So, anyway, that’s personally I’m most excited about. But like I said, it could be just like, okay, I weirdly like it and other people don’t. That’s possible. But we’re gonna make it anyway, and then we will just have a niche audience, I don’t know. But if it does, then we’ll make a more conventional pickup truck."
Do you have a motorcycle?,"No. I rode motorbikes a lot when I was a kid. So I did, like, dirt biking and then rode a motorcycle on the road. And then I almost got killed when I was 17, so ... "
"Yes, I remember.","Yeah. So it’s like I ... You know, most people are paralyzed, but depending on how you count it, the probability of death in a motorcycle versus —"
It’s quite high.,It’s 25 times higher.
"Yeah, my brother is a doctor. He calls them donor-mobiles, actually.",Yeah. Like organ donors. 
"Yeah, that’s exactly why he calls it that.","Yeah, so, the thing is, I rode dirt bikes for six years or more, and did all sorts of crazy jumps and things in the dirt bike, but never got seriously injured. And then —"
But not gonna make one? Not making a Tesla motorcycle?,"Yeah, then I almost got killed ... "
Bad memories.,A truck knocked ... I got hit by a truck.
What about a plane?,Literally got hit by a truck.
Yeah. ,"So, we’re not gonna make motorcycles. But a few more Tesla products that are cool: We’re almost done with the development of the solar tile roof. So we have those on a few hundred roofs right now. And we’re just doing testing to make sure they have long-term durability."
"These are tile roofs, these are tiles on the roofs? Yeah.","Yeah, the solar tile roof where it looks like a normal, beautiful tile roof. But it’s actually solar. And, like, that development process is longer than we’d like, because we’ve got to make sure that the roof’s gonna stand up for 30 years."
Sure.,"And even when you do accelerated lab testing on a solar roof, it still takes a while. And we’ve gotta put a lot of work into making the installation process easy, so it doesn’t take ages to install a roof."
Or rely on government subsidies.,"Yeah. Long-term, there won’t be any government subsidies. Those are just kind of like short-term things."
I agree. You’d be surprised to know I do have a solar roof. And have had one for 10 years.,Oh cool. Great. Thank you. Good.
"I think I have a real old one. I think it’s super old, and it seems to be working just fine.","Yeah. I mean you probably have the retrofit solar, like that’s on top of a normal roof. "
Yes.,So we have that. We’ve like kind of a regular —
This is tiles. This is the tile —,This is integrated with the roof.
Right.,"So the solar tile roof, where it’s integrated with the roof. You don’t even realize it’s solar. And of course we have the conventional retrofit solar, so we are working on, you know, steadily improving the aesthetics of the retrofit solar. "

This is within the homes?,"I can’t talk more about it, but there’s —"
Presumably.,We have a large product on the stationary storage side that I think will be very compelling for utility customers. 
"Okay, all right. So, a Roadster. Any planes?",No plans to make planes at Tesla.
No plans to make planes at Tesla.,SpaceX and dying on Mars
"All right. Well let’s get to rockets then. SpaceX. Last time we talked, you said you wanted to die on Mars, just not on landing. Which was a very funny joke, although it’s probably not a joke, it’s probably —","Well, it’d be ironic if that had happened."
"Well, you know.","Better not ... I think we just be careful ... I have to be careful about tempting fate, because I think often the most ironic outcome is the most probable."

Yeah. “This is how Elon Musk must die!”,"Reality, yes."
“He must die in landing on Mars.”,It might happen.
Right.,"You know, like the ... It just very often seems like reality tries to ... Actually, technically, there’s a friend of mine, Jonah Nolan, who had this like modification of Occam’s razor where he said he thinks “the most ironic outcome is the most likely.” And then I think that there’s some truth to that. And then also I think sometimes the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. Whether that entertainment is in the nature of drama, comedy or something else —"
What would be more entertaining than that? You tripping on the way to see the martian and just banging your head?,I mean hopefully me dying on impact on Mars is not the most entertaining outcome.
"No, that’s not entertaining.",Yeah. Yeah.
It’s ironic.,"’Cause then what happens next? It’s like, okay, you’re a crater."
"Yeah. Right, right. That’s true. Okay. All right. Okay. Let’s start ... instead of discussing your death, your impending doom, let’s discuss what’s going on at SpaceX, which has had a more, a smoother ride, so to speak, of what you’re all doing with the rockets. You’re gonna do an astronaut? What are some of the things you’re doing?","Yes. Yeah, so this year’s been great for SpaceX."
Right.,"We successfully launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, which is the most powerful rocket in the world by a factor of two. So that’s twice the power, twice the thrust of the next biggest rocket. And we actually launched a Tesla — my Tesla Roadster to Mars orbit. And although ... Like a lot of people thought this was like some ego thing or whatever, but ..."
"Well it feels stunty, come on. You’re launching a —",It’s ... I’m trying to ...
It’s a stunt. You’re trying to —,"I’m trying to listen to the reality simulation, which is do the most entertaining thing."
"Yes, exactly. Okay.",That’s pretty entertaining.
"All right, it is. It sure is.","And you know, we had a lot of, you know, like playing David Bowie. And where, like, “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” stuff in there, we’ve got the Asimov Foundation series etched in glass. Like there’s a lot of like little things."
Anything really weird you stuck in there you didn’t tell anybody about?,No.
Like a sandwich? I don’t know.,There might be. I don’t know all the things that are on there. But there’s probably some weird things in there. 
There might be. I don’t know all the things that are on there. But there’s probably some weird things in there. ,"The ... like the reason we did that is actually because, normally, when a new rocket is launched, you just put a dummy payload, which is like a block of concrete or something. Like, literally, I think when Boeing launched the Delta IV Heavy, they launched a block of concrete or something. "
Right. Not creative in any way.,Super-boring.
Right. Super-boring.,"So we were like, okay, what is the least boring thing we can launch?"

For rockets?,Yeah to catch the nose cone when it’s falling back from space.
Okay. All right. Okay.,"Yeah, that’s pretty fun."
And you caught it?,"No. No. We missed, unfortunately."
"Okay, all right.",But we get close. We got close.

Okay.,And it sort of —
"What’s the net made out of? Metal, right?","No, I think, like, nylon or Kevlar."
Okay.,"Yeah, so we were close to catching the fairing. And then next year, the exciting things are we’re gonna be launching astronauts for the first time to the space station."

What do you think of the Space Force? The Trump Space Force?,"Well, this may be a little controversial, but I actually like the idea. I think it’s cool. You know, like, when the Air Force was formed, there was a lot of like pooh-poohing, and like, “Oh, how silly to have an Air Force!” You know, because the aircraft in World War II were managed by the Army."
Right.,"And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft. And so the Air Force was created. "

"Out there, to do what?","Well, I mean, I kinda think it’s ... You know, it’s basically defense in space. And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization ... You know, expanding things beyond Earth."
Right.,"You know, the Space Force could be something that ... Like, I think we could just have a base on the moon, for example. A base on Mars. Be great to expand on the idea of a Space Force. "

"Yeah. Do you think the Trump administration has a commitment to it, or is it just, “Let’s have a Space Force?”",I don’t know ... I haven’t had detailed conversations.
Right. Right.,But I do think it will become obvious over time that a Space Force is a sensible thing to do.
But I do think it will become obvious over time that a Space Force is a sensible thing to do.,Going to Mars
"All right. And, Mars. Last time we talked it was 2024, was it? That you talked about getting there?","Yeah, we’re still aiming for 2024."
Okay. And you going? Or someone going?,"I don’t know if I will go or not. It may be just an unmanned mission, you know. I’m not sure if there’ll be people onboard or not. "
"I don’t know if I will go or not. It may be just an unmanned mission, you know. I’m not sure if there’ll be people onboard or not. ","But there is a Mars rendezvous opportunity, ’cause you can only do a launch to Mars roughly every two years.

Try to do this?,Yes.
And working with the U.S. government? Working with?,"Well, I suspect by the time we make enough progress to wanna try to do it, I suspect that the U.S. government will be interested in doing this, too, or being part of the effort. But I think ... the vehicle that we’re designing right now, which is sort of code-named BFR, I’m thinking of changing the official name to Heart of Gold."
Okay. As in Neil Young?,"Well, I do like that song, but it’s more like the spaceship in “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.”"
"Oh, right. Oh, sure, yeah.",And it’s powered by infinite improbability. I still think it’s the great ... This is like a very great power source.
What was BFR? What did BFR stand [for]?,"BFR is, to some degree, a Rorschach test on acronyms. But officially, it is the Big Falcon Rocket."
"Okay, the Big Falcon. What is the other thing you want to call it? Big Fucking Rocket, what?",It’s a Rorschach test.
"Okay, Big Fucking Rocket. That’s what I would say, that would be mine. So, how do you assess your ... Again, first of all, one, do you think NASA should continue to exist, or all these space agencies by the government? How do you look at competitors, say, like what Jeff Bezos is doing?","Yeah, I certainly think NASA should continue to exist, NASA does a lot of really useful things, and these go beyond astronaut transport. There are missions to rovers on Mars that are thanks to NASA. There are these planetary probes, there’s the Hubble Telescope, there’s a ... So, NASA does a tremendous amount of good, so I definitely think we should ... NASA should continue, and ideally we should actually increase the budget of NASA, and we’re really ...

"Probably. Yeah, I just saw the movie, the “First Man,” it was like —","Yeah, it’s like, if it’s not the most inspiring ... I think it’s the most inspiring thing in history for Earth as a whole. We should try to do more of that stuff."
"To Mars, or wherever.",Yeah.
Yeah.,"Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin and Amazon"
"All right, we’ve got to get through a couple more things, I know you have limited time. But how do you look at what Bezos is doing with Blue Origin, because I suppose that’s the most comparable private thing going on?","Yeah, I think it’s great that Jeff is spending lots of money on space. And they are a competitor, but it’s good that he’s spending money on ... that he’s spending a lot of money on developing rockets. I think it will encounter some challenges getting to orbit, it’s remarkably difficult getting to orbit. But he has the resources to overcome those difficulties."
"He does, he seems to be.","He seems, he’s got some spare —"
He’s got some cash.,"Some spare change in the couch, I think."
"You’re not buying a newspaper, are you?","No, I don’t generally acquire things."
"Yeah, just curious.","I create companies, but I don’t really acquire them. So I wouldn’t ... I have no plans. It does seem to be popular these days."
"It is, it is. Benioff bought one, but ... yeah.","Yeah, yeah, totally."
What would you buy if you could?,"Wait, is there something you think I should buy?"
"I don’t know, what do you want to buy?","I mean, do you have any suggestions?"
"I don’t know ... I was just interviewing the publisher of the New York Times and I said, “Would you like a billion dollars from one of these people?” He didn’t want it, I found that unusual. Think of the things you could do with a billion dollars.",Don’t know.
"Jeff has more of them than other people, but ... you know?","Yeah, he does have a lot. Speaking of the vagaries of stock price, though, it’s like Amazon shot way up and then it went down. And I think Amazon is a great company and Jeff’s done some amazing things, and Amazon is obviously one of the greatest companies in the world. But I imagine that they experienced challenges when the stock price rises so much and then falls, and it’s —"
"Yeah, not quite as much as you. It’s usually over a package delivery, it’s not quite the same level of difficulty.","Yeah, but it’s, what, dropped 30 percent or something. That’s quite a lot, you know?"
"Yes, it does, it goes up and down. And he faces issues with the government and everything else, and the tax, and stuff like that. ","The Boring Company, dad jokes and drilling technology"
"So let’s finish up the last two things. Boring Company, I was just with Eric Garcetti in Los Angeles —","Oh, great, yeah. Eric’s been a —"
He’s a big fan.,"Yeah, Eric’s been a great supporter."
"Yeah, he has. He says, “Anything to cut traffic.” He doesn’t care. And he told me he thought ... I was like, “Why do you think these people are interested in traffic so much?” And he said, “Because no matter how rich you are, everybody can get caught in traffic. And so they just want to do something about it.”","Yeah, Eric’s been really supportive of our activity in L.A. I mean, technically, our first tunnels are in Hawthorne. But we do expect to, over time, create a network of tunnels under greater L.A. And I think this is really the key to getting around the city very fast. You’ve got to go 3-D. Essentially, we have a 3-D ... our offices are 3-D and dense, but we then have a 2-D road transport network, so it’s ... And everyone would just go in and out of the buildings at the same time, so, naturally, you’re going to have traffic. It’s like —"
"So you’re thinking all around, lots of roads within the tunnels?","Yeah, many levels of tunnels, so —"
"Right, like a subway system?","Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional. You’ll have a subway cross another subway, but they’ve never really tried to make many layers of subways. The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive. And they’ve also been incredibly slow. So, if it takes ... I don’t know how long. Say the New York Subway had a one-mile extension or something, and it cost —"
"Well, San Francisco, they’re still building it.","Yeah, exactly. I know that L.A. has a subway, although people don’t ... most people don’t —"
"It’s good, I use it.",Is it good?
"Yeah, it’s good.",You’re the first person I’ve met that actually uses the subway.
"I use it, sure. I use all public transportation.","Well, they had a two-mile extension, or two-and-a-half-mile extension on the subway that cost $2 billion. So the typical cost for a subway, per-mile cost for a subway in the U.S. has been about a billion dollars a mile, so that is not a very scalable solution."
So tunnels?,"Yeah, so you really have to ... We have to massively improve the technology associated with digging tunnels so that —"
"And the tunnels themselves, being 3-D tunnels versus 2-D tunnels?","Being many layers. I mean, you could do ... you could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don’t do it. But you can go down 100 levels if you want to, you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other, it’s ... You can go further down than you can go up. So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. That’s the linchpin, that’s fundamentally what it amounts to. And as I got sort of digging into tunnels ... Ha-ha, good one."
"Do you say that? Please don’t do that, you need to stop. Is that how you amuse yourself?","Yeah, yeah, no, I’ve got a million of ’em."
“Digging in?”,Tunnels are really so underappreciated.
"They are, okay. All right, okay.",They have no place to go but down.
"Oh my god. All right, okay. These are dad jokes, you know that?","I am a dad, so —"
"I get that, but —","Yeah, totally. So —"
"I’m glad you’re amused with yourself, go ahead.","Yeah, no, no I definitely am amused by myself, it’s a terrible habit. Terrible habit."
"That’s obvious. So, tunnels!","Yes, tunnels. So, the —"
"Elon, you’re not even high and you’re laughing at yourself, come on, let’s ... Tunnels! Tunnels!","No no, it’s a terrible habit, I laugh at my own jokes, even with the terrible ones. So, what I discovered is that there are massive improvements possible in tunneling technology, and I found ... I always look at things from a fundamentals-of-physics standpoint, and so if you sort of apply physics’ first principles to any given technology endeavor, you can sort of envelop the possibilities. And what I discovered in talking to the engineering heads of the various tunneling companies is that they actually did not know what ... I had no idea what the true potential of tunneling was."
"No no, it’s a terrible habit, I laugh at my own jokes, even with the terrible ones. So, what I discovered is that there are massive improvements possible in tunneling technology, and I found ... I always look at things from a fundamentals-of-physics standpoint, and so if you sort of apply physics’ first principles to any given technology endeavor, you can sort of envelop the possibilities. And what I discovered in talking to the engineering heads of the various tunneling companies is that they actually did not know what ... I had no idea what the true potential of tunneling was.","’Cause the first question I’d ask is, “Well, is your tunneling machine power-limited or thermally limited?” This was a very obvious question from a physics standpoint. Nobody knew. None of them could answer that question. I was like, “Okay, this is not a good sign.” And the answer is, basically everything’s power-limited within the framework of how much you can transport heat away from the face using some sort of liquid cooling system. But we’re so far away from that, it’s ... We’re crazy far away from that."
Of being able to do that?,"No, of being anywhere near the thermal limit. Things like increasing power is relatively easy, and then you hit the threshold where you’ve added so much power that you’re melting the drill head."
"Exactly, yeah.","So then you have to put a lot of effort into cooling the drill head in order to not melt it, or go with advanced ceramics. But then you still have to cool the bearings and the bearing housings. So I’m used to a lot of this stuff from rocket engine design, for example. The turbopump on the Merlin engine runs at like 36,000 RPM. It’s got 10,000 horsepower and weighs —"
So applying the rocket technology to what you’re doing with tunneling?,"Yeah, essentially taking rocket technology and automotive technology and applying it to drilling technology."
"Right, so the problem is, it’s too hot? It’s too hot.","We need to massively crank up the power to the drill head, and then ... then we need to cool it. But the first step is simply jacking up the power like crazy, and then automating the placement of the tunnel reinforcements, so that the tunnel —"
So you don’t have to continue to be going slowly and building it?,"Yeah, like right now, tunnel machines will drill for a bit and then they’ll stop, and people will put in ... very slowly put in the —"
The reinforcements?,The reinforcing segments. And so tunneling machines basically go at half-speed.
"Right, I think of that a lot about house construction, how slow it is. Why is house construction so slow?","Well, you can make house construction crazy-fast if you’re in a factory."
"Yes, or other ways. Just a totally different topic, but it’s the same.","Yeah, construction in general is ... I think there’s a lot of potential for disruption and for entrepreneurs to enter construction in general. There’s a tremendous amount of opportunity. Anyway, so massively cranking up the power of the drill, then making the drill battery-powered ... which is not something they’d ever considered. But if you don’t make it battery-powered then you’ve got to have this massive cable —"
Behind it?,"Yeah. And then the cable, in order to have the cable manageable at all, has to be an 11 kVA ... 11,000 volts cable, and even then it’s thick. And then you’ve got to have step-down transformers for the drill head-"
Down the way?,"Because the drill head’s going to operate at 480 volts or thereabouts, it’s not going to operate at 11,000. So you’ve got these massive transformers, this crazy cable length, the —"
Slow?,"Yeah, it’s very slow, and then this is what blew my mind. They’re using a diesel locomotive. The standard practice is to use a diesel locomotive to transport the tunneling segments to the drill head and to transport the dirt out, and to use it — and a one-way."
So it’s like an old coal mine?,"Yeah, it’s pretty weird. So, if you’ve got a diesel locomotive in a tunnel, then you’ve got to put massive effort into blowing clean air into the tunnel and getting ... ’cause you’ve got the —"
How else would you get the dirt out?,"Oh, well, we’d just use an electric car."
"Right, right, right.","Yes, we took a Model 3 chassis and converted that into a train, a Model 3-powered train chassis, and so now we have a —"
"So you don’t need to worry about the rest of this stuff, right? No tracks, no?","It’s not consuming oxygen and spewing noxious fumes, this was a big improvement."
"Right, so when are these happening? When is this ... when will one be useful? The Hawthorne one? The test tunnel, it’s a test tunnel?","Yeah, we’re about to finish the first test tunnel."
At what cost?,"I don’t know, I think it’s probably ... Excluding the equipment, probably cost us $10 million for a mile."
"Right, to put this in? To put this in. So, I’m going to finish up —","It’s one-way, admittedly, but —"
"So when will people be able to use it, actually use it?","We’re planning on having an opening party on Dec. 10th, in six weeks."
"On December 10th, six weeks?",Yeah.
And what’s gonna go through there?,"Yeah, you wanna come?"
"Sure, I’ll come.","Yeah, this’ll be a very one-dimensional party."
"It’s the day before my birthday, that would be great. That would be great, or something. One-dimensional party, very funny, very funny. ","Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi investors and techlash"
"So, I’m going to finish up. One thing I didn’t ask ... All this is money, the amount of investment you put in here. Did you, when you had been looking to go private with Tesla ... I just have a few more questions. When you had been looking to go private with Tesla, you had talked to the Saudis, how do you feel about them now? I ask every internet executive this now, given the amount of money they have in the system.","Yeah, well I mean, it’s important to appreciate that the Saudis have been approaching me for two years about going private. It wasn’t like spur-of-the-moment."
But I’m talking about in the wake of Khashoggi’s murder.,"Yeah, I mean, that sounds pretty bad. So ... that is not good. That is bad."
That is bad.,"That was really bad, it was really —"
"So, do you think about that? Because there’s been this sort of techlash against Facebook, that’s not your area, Facebook and social media ... But there’s been a real backlash against where the money is coming from, the damage on society. You’re not the only person in tech, but it all washes over tech. How do you look at that?","Sorry, are you asking about the Saudis or something else? Okay."
Let me ask about the Saudis first. Would you take their money now?,"I think we probably would not, yes."
"Okay, and what about their influence in Silicon Valley, given the billions that are being poured in here?","I know I can’t speak to that, I mean, it’s not ... Saudi Arabia’s an entire country, so I think you don’t want to, if there’s one really bad thing that occurred, nail down the whole country, it’s not great."
It’s their ruler.,Sure.
"It’s their ruler, it’s the guy who runs everything.","They didn’t elect him, you know?"
"No, they didn’t, that’s right. No, I get that, I’m not impugning all Saudis, but it is the government.","I think we should just consider that there is a whole country, and there’s, you know ... There are a lot of good people in Saudi Arabia, and Saudis who are outside of Saudi Arabia. So I think you cannot paint an entire country with one brush."
"No, no, I’m just talking about the people who have the money.","I think there are serious issues, it’s not good."
"Serious issues. And what about the techlash itself? Again, that’s the word they use, the techlash. I mean, you had been a critic of how — the responsibility around AI, around diversity of AI. About the power that’s held by Facebook and Google and others, in previous interviews we’ve done. How do you look at that now? You’ve been one of the few that have raised issues about worrying about the ethics of it, and everything else?","Yeah, I think there’s probably ... It probably makes sense if something is responsible for a public good, and could potentially negatively affect elections or something like that, that there probably should be some regulatory oversight to ensure that we’re not negatively affecting the democratic process. That the quality of news is good and not unduly influenced. These seem like sensible things."
"Are you still worried about the power that Google ... At the time we’d talked a couple years ago, you were worried about the power that Google and Facebook were assembling in AI, and you were worried about AI itself. And I think one of the things that you had said that really struck me was that it wasn’t going to kill us, it would treat us like house cats. I thought that was a really striking way to think about it.","In the long term, if it ... As AI gets probably much smarter than humans, the relative intelligence ratio is probably similar to that between a person and a cat, maybe bigger. I do think we need to be very careful about the advancement of AI and —"
And you’re still worried about it in that way?,"Yeah, I think ... I mean, my recommendation for the longest time has been consistent. I think we ought to have a government committee that starts off with insight, gaining insight. Spends a year or two gaining insight about AI or other technologies that are maybe dangerous, but especially AI. And then, based on that insight, comes up with rules in consultation with industry that give the highest probability for a safe advent of AI."
You think that — do you see that happening?,I do not.
You do not. And do you then continue to think that Google —,"No, to the best of my knowledge, this is not occurring."
Do you think that Google and Facebook continue to have too much power in this? That’s why you started OpenAI and other things.,"Yeah, OpenAI was about the democratization of AI power. So that’s why OpenAI was created as a nonprofit foundation, to ensure that AI power ... or to reduce the probability that AI power would be monopolized."
Which it’s being?,"There is a very strong concentration of AI power, and especially at Google/DeepMind. And I have very high regard for Larry Page and Demis Hassabis, but I do think that there’s value to some independent oversight."
"There is a very strong concentration of AI power, and especially at Google/DeepMind. And I have very high regard for Larry Page and Demis Hassabis, but I do think that there’s value to some independent oversight.",How is Musk feeling about the future?
"They’re in the thing. All right, very last question. I’m not going to go into “simulation,” because that’s the last time you blew everybody’s mind when we talked. Are we still in a simulation? No? Yes? This would be quite a thing right now.","I think sometimes when I mention the simulation, people infer that, “Well, therefore we shouldn’t take what appears to be reality seriously.” And I do think we should take what appears to be reality seriously, yeah."
"Okay, but you did say there was a chance that we are still in a ... Last time we talked —","I said, “What appears to be reality.”"
"You’re right, you said it, you’re right. Okay, in this reality, when you look at it, how are you feeling about the future, when what appears to be reality ...?","For some reason, I feel optimistic. And I’m not sure if that is irrational or not, but that is my —"
Why are you feeling that?,My current gut feel is weirdly optimistic.
"Because, given this polarization?","I don’t know, don’t know."
"Does this polarization affect you? You’ve pulled yourself off the Trump councils, I know you and I talked about whether ... I said you shouldn’t go ’cause he was gonna screw you, remember? We had a whole —","Well, you were right."
"I am right, thank you, Elon. I know that. But you feel, in the midst of this polarization, these bombings, the president continually being divisive, you feel optimistic?","Yeah. By the way, I still think it was worth trying on the Trump ... to be on the Trump councils, and especially just to be an advocate for climate, I did my absolute best, and it’s sort of —"
"Yes, I know you did. I think I called you, I think I said, “You’re not Jesus, it’s not going to work.”",I definitely do not think I am Jesus.
"No, I know you don’t. I think I was just trying to egg you into getting off the councils.","Arguably, it was unlikely, but it was worth a shot, yeah."
"Right, would you do it again?","Do you mean now, or ...?"
Yeah.,"I don’t know, are there councils?"
"No, there aren’t. Do you continue to engage on climate and the things that are important to you? I know gay rights and transgender rights are, also.","Yes. And, actually, I’m not sure if you know this but in terms of ... LGBTQIA? This like a very quite complicated —"
"Mm-hmm, whatever. Don’t, don’t.","Yeah, but —"
You’ll miss a letter.,"Totally. I’m like, “Do I have all the letters?”"
"Totally. I’m like, “Do I have all the letters?”","There’s a new letter, no there’s a new one."
"There’s a new letter, no there’s a new one.","Oh no, okay. But there’s an independent organization that evaluates companies in terms of their ... let’s at least for now, say just LGBTQ-friendliness. And we’ve gotten 100 out of 100 every year for like four or five years running, so —"
"Yes, you’ve been very supportive.","Yeah, absolutely."
"But optimistic, you’re optimistic, given all this polarization? Are you not worried about it? Are you thinking about the midterm elections?","I am thinking about the midterm elections, and I did vote, by the way."
"Me, too, today.",Though I do wonder what effect a vote in California has.
"Right, fair point.","There’s so much gerrymandering of electoral districts that it seems like ... I voted for the sake of voting, but things are very divisive right now, politically. But it’s probably not wise for me to wade into political debates, it’s a no-win situation."
"Right, I got it. But how do you feel — as a citizen, how do you feel?","I definitely wish people wouldn’t yell at each other quite so much, I wish there was less hate."
"Any solutions? I guess you can’t come up with a gadget for that, can ya?","No. I mean, I think the ... I feel we’re doing a lot of good here at Tesla on the climate stuff, and also making products people love. It’s one thing to make an electric car, but can we also make a product that people love, that really makes them happy?"
"Right, well that’s the point, right?","There’s not many products you can buy that really make you happier. And so Apple did that for a long time, I still think, obviously, that Apple makes great phones, and —"
"The earbuds make me very happy, I don’t know why.",The ones without the cable?
"Without the cable, I love them. I look terrible, I love them. You know, the earbuds [AirPods]?","Yeah, the one without the cable?"
"I still like Apple products, they still make me happy.","No, I still use an iPhone and everything. But Apple used to really bring out products that would blow people’s minds, you know?"
Right.,"And still make great products, but there’s less of that."
That’s your goal?,"There’s less of that. I don’t think people are necessarily running to the store for the iPhone 11. But I think with Tesla, we really want to make products that people just love, that are heart-stopping."
"There’s less of that. I don’t think people are necessarily running to the store for the iPhone 11. But I think with Tesla, we really want to make products that people just love, that are heart-stopping.","If he got one redo on something from 2018, what would he redo?"
"Right, okay, my last question. If you had to redo anything this year, Elon, what would it be? Besides your ... apparently, you did sumo wrestling? Obviously that’s one of —",That was five years ago.
"Okay, all right.",My back still hurts.
"Your back still hurts. What would you redo, and you can’t pick sumo wrestling.","I would definitely not do that again. Forty-five minutes of sumo wrestling has caused me five years of back pain, so ... I mean, it’s fair to say I would probably not have tweeted some of the things I tweeted, that was probably unwise. And probably not gotten into some of the online fights that I got into. I probably shouldn’t have attacked journalists, probably shouldn’t have done that."
I don’t know why you do it.,Yes.
"Yeah, do you want to say you’re sorry? No. You can if you want.",I’m sorry to some journalists.
"Okay, I’ll give you that, I’ll give you that. Okay, I’ll give you that. Elon, podcast secured.","Thank you, Kara. It was great to see you."
"Thank you so much, I appreciate it. You kept your promise. Elon and I have been emailing about this, and you do keep your promise compared to a lot of other people, and I appreciate it.","Always, it was great to see you."
"Always, it was great to see you.",Why Tesla won’t make a scooter
"It’s been a really fascinating discussion, and I will think about buying an electric car, probably not. I’m not going to try to —","I mean, why not?"
"Make a scooter. Make a scooter and I’ll go for it. They actually are electric, what am I talking about? They’re electric.","I don’t know, there was some people in the studio who wanted to make a scooter, but I was like, “Uh, no.”"
"I love the scooter, no, get on the scooter.",It lacks dignity.
"No, it doesn’t lack dignity.",Yes they do.
"They don’t lack dignity, what are you talking about?",Have you tried driving one of those things? They —
"Yes, I do it all the time, I look fantastic.","They do not, you are laboring under an illusion."
"I truly do. Well, I think I look good, and therefore —",This is an illusion.
“It lacks dignity.”,It lacks dignity.
"All right, well, everybody at Lime, don’t worry, Elon Musk is not coming for you.","Electric bike, I think we might do an electric bike, yeah."

"It is Halloween night, and I have gotten my treat, which I’ve been asking for a while. I’m here with Elon Musk at the headquarters of Tesla. Is that right? The right pronounce? Is it Tesla or Tezla?","Tesla, yeah."
Whatever.,"By the way, I think your costume is great."
"I’m here with delicious coffee. We are gonna have a long discussion about all kinds of things. Elon’s been very nice to do this in the evening, here. We’ve been chatting about all kinds of things, but we’re gonna get into it really quick. We’re gonna talk about Tesla, we’re gonna talk about SpaceX, we’re gonna talk about this year, we’re gonna talk about The Boring Company, and anything else Elon wants to talk about, because people like to hear you talk.",Using Twitter without a filter
"What’s Twitter? Okay, let’s start with Twitter. I have an obsession with Twitter, too, and an addiction. How do you look at that with you? What is going on?",What’s going on?
What happens? What happens with you and Twitter?,"Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter."
And why?,"I find it entertaining. I think, “Oh, other people might find this entertaining.” Sometimes they do."
And sometimes ...,Yeah. It’s pretty random.
"Just at night? What are you, at home you’re doing this?",Yeah. Mostly at home. I spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think. It’s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something.
"Yeah, well people pay attention when you do that.","Yeah. It’s pretty interesting what my most ... What people are most interested in, like some little tweet about “I love anime.” That was it. But it was lowercase “i”, black heart, “anime,” and people loved that. That was like one of my most popular tweets."
What about the things they didn’t love? Are you under strict orders not to do that? Is that correct? Will you be? Will you have to change your Twitter behavior?,Not really.
Not really.,"Under the recent settlement, you don’t have to be careful about what you tweet? If it’s anime, that’s one thing."
But if it’s just business you can’t.,"No, I think it’s mostly just if it’s something that might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours. That’s about it."
That’s about it. So you can’t do that.,"Without somebody getting mad, no."
"That’s a lot of people getting mad. Would you consider it ... I’m gonna get off it in a second, but do you consider it a communications medium? How do you look at it? A lot of us use it that way. I use it that way. Obviously, Donald Trump uses it that way. How do you look at it?","I look at it as a way to learn things, kinda stay in touch with what’s happening. It feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society. That’s what it feels like. It’s kinda weird. I guess I sometimes use Twitter to express myself, and that’s a weird thing to do, I suppose."
"Not so much. It isn’t. Sometimes it’s very funny, other times it’s not so funny.",Some people use their hair to express themselves; I use Twitter.
"Yes, it was.",Oh.
Don’t do that.,I was just ... I forgot which one it was.
"No. It’s like you had some name ... Look it, you’re cackling on Halloween!",Picking fights with the press
"Explain that, please.","The amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable. Take that Wall Street Journal front-page article about like, “The FBI is closing in.” That is utterly false. That’s absurd. To print such a falsehood on the front page of a major newspaper is outrageous. Like, why are they even journalists?"
Do you understand —,They’re terrible.
"I get that, but do you understand the mood in this country around the press and the dangers of attacking, especially when the president is doing that? In quite an aggressive, “enemy of the state” and everything else. It’s disturbing when someone like you as a leader does that, too, or goes along with it.","The answer is for the press to be honest and truthful, and research their articles and correct things properly when they are false. Which they don’t do."
What do you think of that? Are you worried about unleashing a dangerous cycle that a lot of the press are worried about? Justifiably.,I suggest the press take it to heart and do better.
"What about what Donald Trump does, about “enemy of the people”? Do you look at it that way?",No.
Just that you don’t like falsehoods.,"Yeah. There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it’s gonna get. Then somebody is not a journalist, they are an ad salesman. Not a journalist, an ad salesman."
What about things that are just critical of you that you don’t like? Do you think you’re particularly sensitive?,"No. Of course not. Count how many negative articles there are and how many I respond to. One percent, maybe. But the common rebuttal of journalists is, “Oh. My article’s fine. He’s just thin-skinned.” No, your article is false and you don’t want to admit it."
That’s a fair point.,"Not easily. Physics is very demanding. If you get it wrong, the rocket will blow up. Cars are very demanding. If you get it wrong, a car won’t work. Truth in engineering and science is extremely important."
Right. And therefore?,I have a strong interest in the truth.
All right. And you are —,Much more than journalists do.
"What I’m trying to get to is, do you want to acknowledge when you do this it does set off ... People beyond you that listen to you, you have a fan base that’s quite rabid, I would say.","No, I wouldn’t say that."
No?,I think they’re great.
All of them?,"No, not all of them."
Right. Okay.,The “excruciating” year of 2018
"Let’s talk about this year. What has gone on this year with you? It’s a very roller-coaster year. How would you explain it? You did a very emotional interview in the New York Times, and I promise we’ll get to Tesla and all the other things we want to talk about, but what has happened to you this year? How would you put it?",It’s been a very difficult year.
Why is that?,"We had the Model 3 production ramp, which was excruciatingly difficult. It is incredibly difficult to survive as a car company. Incredibly difficult. People have no idea how much pain people at Tesla went through, including myself. It was excruciating."
And talk about that toll.,"Pretty sure I burnt out a bunch of neurons during this process. Running both SpaceX and Tesla is an incredibly difficult ... You realize we’re fighting the incredibly competitive car companies. They make very good cars. They’ve been doing this for a long time. They are entrenched. Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Lexus, you name it. All those car brands. And the history of car companies in America is terrible. The only ones that haven’t gone bankrupt are Tesla and Ford. That’s it. Everyone else has gone bankrupt."
"So, the pressure of doing this.",Yes.
Absolutely.,It is insanely difficult to make it successful.
"You put too much pressure on yourself this year, or it just is what you’re doing?",It sounds like you’re not hearing me.
All right. Try it again.,"Making a car company successful is monumentally difficult. There have been many attempts to create a car company and they have all failed, even the ones that have had a strong base of customers, thousands of dealers, thousands of service centers, they’ve already spent the capital for the factories, like GM and Chrysler, still went bankrupt in the last recession. Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession. There’s a good chance Ford doesn’t make it in the next recession. So, as a startup, a car company, it is far more difficult to be successful than if you’re an established, entrenched brand. It is absurd that Tesla is alive. Absurd! Absurd."
What do you credit that to?,Excruciating effort.
By you and —,Hundred-hour weeks by everyone.
By everyone here at Tesla.,Yes. There wasn’t some other way to do this.
That’s what I’m saying —,"There wasn’t some other way to do this, Kara."
While you’re also running a space company and other ones.,Yes.
What I want to get at is why you’re doing that. It’s not a trivial … Why do you think you want to push yourself that hard?,"Well, the other option would have been, Tesla dies."
Right.,"Yeah. Tesla cannot die. Tesla is incredibly important for the future of sustainable transport and energy generation. The fundamental purpose, the fundamental good that Tesla provides is accelerating the advent of sustainable transport and energy production."
100 percent.,Yeah. Into electric cars. They’ve said so.
"No, there’s no question. I was just having a discussion with someone the other day, and I said, “He has pushed everybody into this, really dramatically. There wouldn’t have been this much investment. There wouldn’t have been this.”","Yes. It’s very important for the future of the world. It’s very important for all life on Earth. This supersedes political parties, race, creed, religion, it doesn’t matter. If we do not solve the environment, we’re all damned."
Ford Fiesta.,Okay.
"I’m trying to get rid of my car, actually. I’m trying to actually get rid of it.t",Sure. I’m shaming you into buying you an electric car.
No. I don’t drive my car very much. It sits in the garage. I try not to drive my car at all.,Driving something.
When you get to this ... You’re doing this to yourself because you think that the world depends ... Not the fate of the world. You’re not a cartoon character.,"No, I think the electrification of transport, and there’s also an important part of Tesla which is solar and stationary batteries, because you need to generate electricity in a standard, sustainable way with solar and then store it at night when the sun goes down with batteries, and then use that energy from the sun to power cars. Without Tesla, this would still happen. There would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer. History will judge this, obviously, but I would say on the order of 10 years, maybe 20 years."
"So, pushing it forward by that much.","Yes. I think it’s probably fair to say that Tesla has advanced sustainable energy by at least five years, conservatively, and maybe closer to 10, and then if we continue to make progress, we might advance it by 20 years. This could be all the difference in the world."
"Yes. I think it’s probably fair to say that Tesla has advanced sustainable energy by at least five years, conservatively, and maybe closer to 10, and then if we continue to make progress, we might advance it by 20 years. This could be all the difference in the world.",The toll on Musk and Tesla’s employees
What is the toll on you? What has been the toll on you and your employees? How do you think about that?,"It’s been terrible. This year felt like five years of aging, frankly. The worst year of my entire career. Insanely painful."
"Was there any other way to do it? You didn’t think there was any other way to have it happen? Why this year? Why this year, of all the others? Because you’ve been at this for many years.","For this past year, it’s been because of the Model 3 production ramp. Myself and others at Tesla, we had to go in and fix the mistakes in the Model 3 production system, and there were a lot of them. I personally solved a bunch. Jerome [Guillen] solved a bunch. Everyone helped, the entire team. Javier [Verdura], Franz [von Holzhausen], Deepak [Ahuja], everyone. It was ... like, we had the legal team delivering cars in Q3. Todd [Maron] is great. There was a lot of people ... Everyone had to basically go hardcore to solve the ramp."
To solve this ramp problem.,"The amount of money that you lose if you don’t solve the ramp is mind-boggling, because you get hit from both sides. Let’s say you’re selling software or something, you don’t —"
"That would be easier, Elon.","It would be a lot easier. But in software you don’t have a bunch of parts. You don’t have a supply chain.

"It would be a lot easier. But in software you don’t have a bunch of parts. You don’t have a supply chain. If you don’t sell software, you lose the revenue, but you don’t incur a massive amount of cost associated with producing the software, ’cause you just make copies pretty easily.","But for any large, complex, manufactured item, you have an entire supply chain, and that supply chain has on the order of six months of inertia. You place the order for parts for the car, including if you’re all the way with like two or three or four suppliers ... We have on the order of 10,000 suppliers. It’s a crazy number. We have to place the orders for how many cars we think we’re gonna build roughly six months in advance, six months before final assembly, ’cause if you go all the way down the supply chain..."

It’s like a flotilla of supertankers. The inertia of that is incredible. If anything happens to stall out the production progress, and that could be any one of those 10,000 suppliers, or on the order of 10,000 internal processes, if any of those is slow or wrong or whatever, you can’t make cars. You only need one missing thing, and whatever the slowest, least lucky part of the production process is, that sets your rate."

So why do you do that?,It’s not intentional.
"Well, okay.","Sometimes you’re just under a lot of pressure, and —"
"No, I’m teasing you. But how do you ... You look well. You don’t look under a lot of pressure. You seem rested.","Yeah. Things are back to a hard work schedule, but not an insane work schedule. I was, there were times when, some weeks ... I don’t know. I haven’t counted exactly, but I would just sort of sleep for a few hours, work, sleep for a few hours, work, seven days a week. Some of those days must have been 120 hours, or something nutty. You’re gonna go a little bonkers if you work 120 hours a week. Now we’re down to 80 or 90. It’s pretty manageable."
"And you had talked in the New York Times about using Ambien and stuff like that. That was to regulate your sleep, correct?",Yeah. It’s not like for fun or something.
"No, not at all.","No, it’s just like, if you’re super-stressed, you can’t go to sleep. You either have a choice of, like, okay, I’ll have zero sleep and then my brain won’t work tomorrow, or you’re gonna take some kind of sleep medication to fall asleep."
"Now you’re to 80 hours, so it’s like totally manageable in that regard.","Yeah, 80 or 90 ..."
You’re just like a regular lawyer in that regard. What is that? I think I’m about 80. I think I’m probably about —,Yeah. 80 is pretty sustainable.
Sustainable for you.,Yeah. The pain level for hours increases exponentially. It’s like nonlinear above 80.

"Let’s talk about Tesla in specific. You turned in a great quarter. These cars are moving off. How do you look at where you’re going with the Model 3 and others? Then I want to get into some of the new features, the navigation features on Autopilot and things like that. How do you look at Tesla right now? I want to first talk about the product, and then talk about the company itself and what you need to move forward.","I think at Tesla we’re doing pretty well right now. Tesla’s not staring death in the face. We’re in, I think, a pretty good position. We don’t want to be complacent, but it’s not ... Up until around September, we were really faced with, like, “We must solve this or we’re gonna die,” constantly. I feel like we’re no longer in the staring-death-in-the-face situation."
"What, is death over and sitting in a seat nearby?","Well, you never want to get complacent, so we still need to work hard, but I think we’re over the hump. We’re certainly over the hump on Model 3 production. For us, making 5,000 cars in a week for Model 3 is not a big deal. That’s just normal. Now we’re working on raising to 6,000 and then 7,000 Model 3s a week, while still keeping costs under control. We could probably do 6,000 or more, maybe 6,500 Model 3s a week right now, but it would have to stress people out and do tons of overtime."
"What about innovations to these models? We’re not talking about other products coming out, but you put in a number of innovations in all the current models.","Our cars are constantly being updated with new technology, so we don’t really have a model year like other car companies. As soon as we come up with some improvement, we just roll it into production."
"Our cars are constantly being updated with new technology, so we don’t really have a model year like other car companies. As soon as we come up with some improvement, we just roll it into production.",Self-driving cars
Talk about the new navigation feature.,Drive on Navigation?
These are things that just happen.,"Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line. Sometimes tar seams look like a line. Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason. One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you’re going either left or right, not down the center. And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection."

"Now we’re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing.",Government regulation
You’re not assuming.,"No. The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver. Eyes are basically just cameras. All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras. A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away. There’s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras."
"You don’t need anything else, from the government or from infrastructure or anything. I was recently talking to the Mercedes people. They were talking about sensors in the roads.","Yeah, that’s hopeless. That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide."
"That works worldwide. How do you look at the regulatory environment, because that’s another thing you have to be dealing with? Here in the U.S., in China, wherever else.","I think the key thing for convincing regulators that self-driving is OK is to show billions of miles with a much better statistical significance in safety than human drivers. If the probability of injury is half that of the average human driver, then I think, probably, regulators will support self-driving. But it has to be a very large population. The statistical population of miles has to be very big, like billions, in essentially almost every possible case."
Right.,Like you can lose races because of that.
So none of the car companies. None of the car companies.,No.
"Do you ever look and go, “Okay, that’s interesting what they’re doing there.”","The other car companies ... I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving."
"The other car companies ... I don’t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving.","You know, I think we’ll get to full self-driving next year. As a generalized solution, I think. But that’s a ... Like we’re on track to do that next year. So I don’t know. I don’t think anyone else is on track to do it next year."
Okay.,"But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall."
"But the issue is that there’s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla’s downfall.","And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars.

Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama, but if we can avoid the distraction of ... If we can avoid the brand damage of ... Let’s say we’re private, and then we went public five years from now. Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place. That was the approximate calculus. And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company’s a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot."
"Yeah, such as?",It’s great.
"Okay, all right.","I mean, I wrote down some of it, but ..."
Do you have a motorcycle?,"No. I rode motorbikes a lot when I was a kid. So I did, like, dirt biking and then rode a motorcycle on the road. And then I almost got killed when I was 17, so ..."
"Yeah, my brother is a doctor. He calls them donor-mobiles, actually.",Yeah. Like organ donors.
But not gonna make one? Not making a Tesla motorcycle?,"Yeah, then I almost got killed ..."
Yeah.,"So, we’re not gonna make motorcycles. But a few more Tesla products that are cool: We’re almost done with the development of the solar tile roof. So we have those on a few hundred roofs right now. And we’re just doing testing to make sure they have long-term durability."
"I think I have a real old one. I think it’s super old, and it seems to be working just fine.","Yeah. I mean you probably have the retrofit solar, like that’s on top of a normal roof."
Right.,"So the solar tile roof, where it’s integrated with the roof. You don’t even realize it’s solar. And of course we have the conventional retrofit solar, so we are working on, you know, steadily improving the aesthetics of the retrofit solar."
"So the solar tile roof, where it’s integrated with the roof. You don’t even realize it’s solar.

We’ve got the Powerpack, which is used for utilities on industrial scale. We’re gonna have some other exciting announcements on the stationary storage front. So when you —"
Presumably.,We have a large product on the stationary storage side that I think will be very compelling for utility customers.

Like, literally, I think when Boeing launched the Delta IV Heavy, they launched a block of concrete or something."
"Okay. All right. All right. So it’s up there. What are the prospects for SpaceX right now? You’ve got the rockets, the Falcon Heavy, you’ve got astronauts?","Yes. Absolutely.
