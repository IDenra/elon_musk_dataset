Yup
Oh so little faith
The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
Start taking orders in April
"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, accelera?"
The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep drivin?
"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
No problem :)
"Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."

Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
Definitely
"Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)"
"Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range & power & fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."

"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"

You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
Mostly anti-drug laws
"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
The remedy for that is changing the law

"No prob. We care about doing what's fair & just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there & we make amends when wrong"
"Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
"Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less & less of the Merc story appears to be true"
Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
"Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri."
Full height of Falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."

Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
"Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely."
@4kpixelsyt yes
"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."

It's probably the Ambien
Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.
coming soon
Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
Max is just 3X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of 1 Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
I love you too!
"Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14, enroute to 36,000 km above Earth"
Thank goodness all are ok
"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
Woohoo!!
"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery"
777 yes
Filtering particulates from air makes a significant & measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
Bioweapon Defense Mode is real This is what happens when you turn it on:
"Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best."
Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
"sides def, center maybe"

Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
"F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg"
"No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
"Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin."
Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy
turns out it doesn't need securing
"yes, several times"
for sure :)
things like this should be purged shortly
100+ for almost everything 10+ for heat shields and a few other items.
Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
"JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
"Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely."
Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand >> supply.
checking into it ...
8tr will definitely do so
"some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
"It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
"A 3 should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better"
That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well :)
"Aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 months, pending detailed examination and 10X refiring of a returned booster"
We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.

Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.
correct
hopefully 0.21
what's the link to that?
"No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity."
no problem
Will cover whole country hopefully this year
"yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster"
less
torque is shifted between front & rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
"Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."
88 Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
01 definitely
should be addressed this year
Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
that's not the real steering system
yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
Some tweaking underway
Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
01 Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
"A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
"cool, thanks!"
"Yes, if the trend continues, before"
276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat

"Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order."
@34thrain Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.
"Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp."

Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
"Thought it would slow way down today, but Model 3 order count is now at 198k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly."
"Model 3 orders at 180,000 in 24 hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!"
Will include India-wide Supercharger network
sure!
Coming in the mail
Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
Just order the SpaceX option package!
"Thanks for tuning in to the Model 3 unveil Part 1! Part 2 is super next level, but that's for later?"
"yes, will cover whole country"
sure is
X and S will also be available
"Adding several more countries to Model 3 order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing & Ireland."
"Model 3 orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person"
Online ordering at will now open at 7:30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at 8:30.
From almost anywhere
"Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model 3. You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up."
Model 3 unveil will be webcast live at 8:30pm California time at

Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
"Great leg room for 3rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
"yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
"Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7."
"That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.

"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it?"
"Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced."
"Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed."
"If speed at stage separation > ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude & distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
steel collet
"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
probably
"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating & rotating."
Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations."
Next launch is a science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.
Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions

Background on the launch
Launch & landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at 8:33pm local tmrw
Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a 10% higher chance of a good landing. Punting 24 hrs.
Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
Meant to reply to this article:
This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence ?
Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.
About 2 mins from static fire
holding for issue resolution
Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
5 mins from static fire test
"yes, from 70F to 20 F"
It worked in Texas
-340 F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.

But credit for 1st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next.
Not quite rarest. SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did 6 suborbital flights 3 years ago & is still around.
The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
"Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit."
"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between space and orbit, as described well by"
Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
"Sounds perfect, you had me at enterprise."
Yeah and hell yeah

Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars & batteries in CA & NV as far into future as I can imagine.
"important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide"
Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
"Autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!"
"Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)"

"Prob good though. Will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter (not needed for launch, but nice to have)."
Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow.
Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission. Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho.

"That works for Dragon, but hard to do for something long like Falcon"
"The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did, but larger:"
No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign & more data. Maybe flight 21.
Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for x-wing style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll.
"Base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel & rocket flyback in future."

"And, uhh no (zillionth person who asked), I am not going to make an IM suit, however design by hand-manipulated hologram is actually useful."
Reality is the best illusion

"Am thinking of doing a movie sequel of sorts to Thank You for Smoking. That was bad CO2 for indiv, this for the planet"
Worth reading Merchants of Doubt. Same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change
"Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone."
"Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost & shift to sustainable energy"
"Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
0xvi11ain Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round

"Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling, dynamic air suspension & mega torque."
"Technically, I got rich from Zip2 & PayPal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into SpaceX, Tesla & SolarCity."
"If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods & critical meds."
"68 Carbon produced by a rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt."
"Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems."
"Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution."
"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)"
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
"Me & other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way."
"There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census."
"Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases."
"Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide."
"Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good & disincent bad."
"Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (), who lives in NC"
Belief in climate change isn't necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.

"Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners."
Tesla raises Model S resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry
Side boosters fall short & center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)
"We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway."
"@2552nsf Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform."
"Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better."
"The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy"
More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.
High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All 4 legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than Model S.
